31584,31592,50358,Istanbul attack: Dozens killed at nightclub,CNN,Euan McKirdy,12/31/16,2016,12,,"Istanbul At least 39 people were killed and at least 69 wounded in an attack in a nightclub early Sunday as they were celebrating the new year, Turkey’s Interior Minister said. ”We are face to face with a terror attack,” Interior minister Suleyman Soylu told reporters.   of the dead have been identified, he said. Of those, 16 were foreign nationals and five were Turkish. US officials also called it a terrorist attack, making it the first of 2017.  Latest developments, The death toll from the Reina nightclub shooting has risen to 39The number of injured is at 69 ”Four of them are in critical condition    one very critical,” says Interior MinisterAt least one gunman still on the run    it is unclear how many attackers were presentNo claim of responsibility has yet been madeUS, Turkish officials say incident is a terrorist attack, Soylu also said that ”the efforts to locate the terrorist are ongoing. Security forces have begun the necessary operations. God willing soon (the attacker) will be apprehended.” Around 1:15 a. m. Sunday, the gunman shot a police officer who was guarding the front gate at the Reina nightclub, killing him, Istanbul Governor Vasip Sahin said.  ”He entered the club and attacked innocent people who were there to celebrate the new year. It was a cruel,   act,” the governor said.  There have been no claims of responsibility. The fate of the attacker    or attackers    was also unclear. ’Crazy people shooting everything’ Witnesses in the club said they heard a loud noise, then a security officer told everyone to get out. One victim said he didn’t know how many attackers there were, but he saw one person and hid.  ”I got shot in the (expletive) leg, man,” he told journalists in English as he was taken into an ambulance. ”These crazy people came in shooting everything.” A security camera captured the moment a gunman dressed in dark clothing dashed into the Reina nightclub as bullets ricocheted in the street.  The assailant, who has not yet been identified, opened fire inside the   nightclub in the busy Besiktas neighborhood, according to Turkish   news agency Anadolu.  Besiktas, on the European shore of the Bosporus, is known for its expensive,   class neighborhoods. The popular area had been under heavy police security for new year celebrations.  Ortakoy, where Reina is located, is a vibrant seaside neighborhood that caters to a wide range of people, from the   who party at clubs like Reina, to students who buy stuffed baked potatoes from vendors along the Bosporus.  Reina itself is one of the first clubs to open along the famous strait and remains a touchstone for Istanbul’s exclusive nightlife. It boasts a classic Istanbul view.  Several analysts said the attack looked more like a   attack.  ”In terms of the   aspects of this attack, it’s a youthful place, a bar that’s pretty   in particular to expats. It’s sort of the lively area of Istanbul, and especially on New Year’s Eve night    all of those have hallmarks of   if not directed attacks to maximize casualties and get a lot of news around it,” said Juliette Kayyem, CNN’s national security analyst.  Turkey’s recent tumult, Turkey has endured a recent wave of terrorist attacks, leaving many people wary.  ”This attack is, of course, a horrible development, but not shocking to many Turks who chose to stay inside this New Year’s Eve,” said Aykan Erdemir, former member of the Turkish Parliament. ”Turkey is known to host these big parties to celebrate New Year’s, but this year most citizens were wary of Islamist attacks so they chose to celebrate it at home with their friends.”  He said the attack seemed similar to what happened at the Bataclan, a Paris concert hall that was attacked by gunmen in 2015.  ”This is an attack on the Western lifestyle. This is an attack on Turkey’s secular, urban way of living. And this will simply fuel the ongoing cultural clashes, the ongoing polarization in Turkey,” Erdemir said.  The United States condemned the attack.  ”That such an atrocity could be perpetrated upon innocent revelers, many of whom were celebrating New Year’s Eve, underscores the savagery of the attackers,” National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said in a statement.  The US State Department said the attacks like this one on its NATO ally ”only reinforce our strong determination to work with the government of Turkey to counter the scourge of terrorism.”  The US Embassy in Turkey warned citizens to avoid the area where the attack occurred.  A violent year, Turkey faces numerous battles across different fronts. Not only has the Syrian conflict and refugee crisis spilled over into Turkey, but Turkey is also battling ISIS and Kurdish militants. Both have staged attacks in Turkey, which is still reeling from a bloody and failed military coup in July. ISIS is suspected in a June attack at Istanbul’s Ataturk Airport that left 44 people dead and an explosion at an August wedding, not far from the border with Syria, that killed at least 54 people. Meanwhile, Turkish security forces clash on an almost daily basis with Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants, mostly in predominantly Kurdish parts of southeastern Turkey. A pair of bombings in Istanbul killed 44 people and wounded 155 others December 10 in an attack by a breakaway group of the PKK. The two explosions occurred after a heavily attended soccer game at Besiktas Vodafone Arena. On December 17, a car bomb exploded near a public bus, killing 13 soldiers in the central province of Kayseri. Three days later, a gunman assassinated Russia’s ambassador to Turkey at an Ankara art gallery. "
31585,31593,50359,"Alabama, Clemson back in national title game",CNN,Jill Martin,12/31/16,2016,12,,"Atlanta (CNN) This season’s College Football Playoff centers on one simple question: Can anyone stop Alabama? Because if it’s not clear by now, it should be: The national championship is the Crimson Tide’s to lose. No. 1 Alabama is back in the national championship game for the second year in a row, winning the Peach Bowl semifinal   against No. 4 Washington at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta. The Crimson Tide’s next opponent is a familiar one. No. 2 Clemson, who lost to Alabama   in the title game last season, pummeled No. 3 Ohio State   in the Fiesta Bowl semifinal at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona to set up a national championship rematch. Alabama ( ) has won four of the past seven titles and is favored again. On Saturday, Alabama’s defense reinforced that it’s the nation’s best, stuffing the Huskies’   offense and scoring a defensive touchdown off an interception. ”I think our defense did a really good job against their explosive, big play receivers and offense that they have, and I’m just really pleased with the way we played together as a team,” Alabama head coach Nick Saban said. Washington, in the College Football Playoff for the first time, ends its season at  . Clemson ( ) meanwhile, asserted its will against Ohio State ( ). Quarterback Deshaun Watson, a   Heisman Trophy finalist who finished second in the voting this season, accounted for three of the Tigers’ touchdowns. Clemson hasn’t won a national championship since the 1981 season. ”What a night,” Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney said. ”What a journey. I just can’t tell you how proud I am of our team, our staff. Just incredible resolve, relentless pursuit to get back here and to try to find a way to win. Just awesome, man.” Alabama defense the greatest ever? Alabama’s dominance this season starts with defense, and the Crimson Tide boast the nation’s best, coming into the Peach Bowl leading the country in total defense, rushing defense, scoring defense and defensive touchdowns. In fact, the Tide’s defense has scored almost as many touchdowns this season (11) as it has allowed (15). One of those defensive scores came Saturday, when Alabama senior linebacker Ryan Anderson picked off Washington sophomore quarterback Jake Browning and took it back 26 yards for the touchdown. That made it a   Crimson Tide lead with 1:13 left in the second quarter. Anderson was named Peach Bowl defensive MVP. Additionally, a forced fumble late in the first quarter by Alabama junior defensive back Anthony Averett led to a   field goal for senior kicker Adam Griffith. The    Huskies entered the Peach Bowl fourth in the nation in scoring offense with 44. 5 points per game. But aside from a   touchdown pass from Browning to junior wide receiver Dante Pettis with 8:01 left in the first quarter, which gave the Huskies at   lead, Washington couldn’t muster much. Following that score, Washington didn’t take a snap in Alabama territory until there was 1:46 left in the game. The Huskies finished with a   194 total yards. ”It was disappointing we didn’t move the ball better,” Washington head coach Chris Petersen said. ”We’ve studied every snap that they’ve had this year, and the tape doesn’t lie when you watch that much tape. I mean, that’s as good a defense as there is out there in college football, and they played like it.” It was a   lead. Alabama answered Washington’s score on the following drive with an   touchdown rush from sophomore running back Bo Scarbrough with 5:01 left in the opening period. Scarbrough also scored on a   run with 11:56 left in the fourth quarter, putting the game firmly out of reach. It was a career day for Scarbrough. He finished with 180 yards    an Alabama bowl record    and two touchdowns. He was named offensive MVP. ”You guys know me,” Saban said. ”Whoever is hot, that’s who’s going to get the ball. And he’s been hot lately, and he’s going to get the ball.” Alabama, which has been ranked No. 1 since the beginning of the season, is making the case for being the greatest team of all time, and now it needs to win just one more game to cap off a perfect season. Since September 2015, Alabama has won 26 consecutive games. It also has won the past three Southeastern Conference championships. Watson stars in Clemson blowout, In big games, Watson has a history of showing up. Saturday was no exception. Clemson’s star junior quarterback was    passing for 259 yards and one touchdown. He also rushed for 57 yards and two scores. With his performance, Watson was named the Fiesta Bowl offensive MVP. It’s the second consecutive year he has earned that honor in a College Football Playoff semifinal, also doing so in the Tigers’ Orange Bowl win against Oklahoma in 2015. ”I just try to play my best and win games,” Watson said. The Buckeyes, on the other hand, were dreadful. Junior quarterback J. T. Barrett threw for just 127 yards and was intercepted twice. Senior kicker Tyler Durbin missed two field goals. It was the first time Ohio State had been shut out since 1993, and it was the first time in Urban Meyer’s head coaching career that he has been shut out. ”Ohio State is not used to this,” Meyer said. ”I’m not used to this, and we will not get used to this. That’s not going to happen again. So we’ll get things worked out.”"

31587,31595,50361,Trump says he has inside information on hacking,CNN,Kevin Liptak,1/1/17,2017,1,,"West Palm Beach, Florida (CNN)  Donald Trump said Saturday he has information that others lack and promised to reveal his knowledge this week, reiterating again his doubts that Russia was behind   in the US election. Speaking to reporters ahead of an   New Year’s Eve bash at his    estate, a tuxedoed Trump maintained that another culprit aside from Russia could have been behind the tampering.  ”It could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don’t know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation,” he said. Asked to describe what undisclosed information he knew, Trump said, ”You’ll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday.”  Trump has scheduled an intelligence briefing midweek on the hacking, a response to President Barack Obama’s announcement of new sanctions on Moscow in retaliation for the  . ”I just want them to be sure, because it’s a pretty serious charge, and I want them to be sure. And if you look at the weapons of mass destruction, that was a disaster, and they were wrong,” Trump said, referencing failed intelligence in the   to the Iraq War as a reason for skepticism. ”I think it’s unfair if they don’t know,” he said. ”And I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove.” Trump has repeatedly cast aside a US intelligence assessment announced in early October that Moscow was behind the hacking, despite already receiving classified intelligence briefings on the matter. He’s also praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling him smart this week for withholding reciprocal sanctions on the US. Trump’s stance has put him at odds with most congressional Republicans, who have argued for a tougher stance on Russia. Sen. John McCain, the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee, will convene a hearing on   Thursday. Officials expelled, On Sunday morning, a Rossiya Airlines Special Flight Squadron plane believed to be carrying some expelled Russian government officials departed Dulles Airport just outside Washington.

A State Department official told CNN early Sunday evening all of the expelled Russian diplomats have left the US. ”We can confirm that the 35 Russian diplomats declared persona non grata have, along with their family members, departed the United States. ,” the official said. Congressional Democrats on Sunday scoffed at Trump’s assertion that Russian involvement wasn’t clear.  ”It’s very solid,” said Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence committee, on ABC’s ”This Week.”  Schiff called Trump’s approach ”dangerous,” adding, ”If he’s going to have any credibility as president, he needs to stop talking this way. He needs to stop denigrating the intelligence.” community.  He’s going to rely on them.  At    Saturday, Trump expressed deep misgivings about technology during his brief exchange with reporters positioned outside his Grand Ballroom.   ”If you have something really important, write it out and have it delivered by courier, the   way, because I’ll tell you what, no computer is safe,” he said. ”I don’t care what they say, no computer is safe.” Scheduled to return to New York Sunday after two weeks at his Palm Beach mansion, Trump told reporters his New Year’s resolution was to ”Make America Great Again.” ”I’ll do that one,” he said."

And the Russian ambassador was gunned down by a man shouting about the Syrian city of Aleppo.  Below are some of the major attacks that occurred this year: December 20: Assassination of top Russian diplomat, A gunman shouting ”Do not forget Aleppo!” assassinated Russia’s ambassador to Turkey at an Ankara art gallery in what leaders of Russia and Turkey called a provocative terror attack.

February 17: Explosion hits military vehicles  An explosion apparently targeting military vehicles in Ankara left 29 dead and 61 wounded, according to Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus. All but one of the fatalities were members of the security forces. Three military vehicles and one private vehicle were stopped at a traffic light when the bomb went off, sending large flames shooting into the night sky.

Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu blamed ISIS, which has entrenched itself in neighboring Syria and Iraq while lashing out elsewhere again and again."
31592,31600,50366,US utility: Alleged Russian malware on laptop,CNN,Evan Perez,12/31/16,2016,12,," (CNN) The indicators from the malicious software found on a Burlington Electric Company laptop match those on malware found in the Democratic National Committee computers that the US government has blamed on Russians, the Department of Homeland Security said Saturday. DHS spokesman Todd Breasseale said the department’s investigation into the cyber intrusion on the computer is ongoing and he couldn’t comment further. The DHS’s acknowledgment is the first such confirmation by the government that the malware is the same as the code used in malicious cyber activity that the US government has blamed on Russian hackers attempting to influence November’s election.  It comes a day after Burlington Electric announced it found the malicious software on a computer that was not connected to its grid control systems. Both the Department of Homeland Security and the utility said Saturday there are no indications that the electric grid was breached.  Burlington Electric General Manager Neale Lunderville told CNN’s Suzanne Malveaux that the utility found an Internet address that was associated with recent malicious cyber activity, and that IP address was communicating with a company computer.  ”We immediately isolated the machine, pulled it off the network, alerted federal authorities and began to work with them,” he said.  Burlington Electric, which serves 19, 600 customers in Vermont, said it found the code after utility companies nationwide were sent an alert by Homeland Security.  The federal government refers to the Russian malicious cyber activity as Grizzly Steppe. Officials involved in the investigation of the malware say they do not believe it was an attempt to bring down part of the electric grid.  One reason why, they cited, is that Burlington Electric is a small utility and therefore the impact would not be as great as if it were a larger company with many more customers.  The Washington Post first reported the existence of the malicious software. Burlington Electric issued a statement Saturday saying that any reports that the company was hacked or breached are false. It added there are no indications that customer information was accessed.  Gov. Shumlin calls Putin a ”thug”  Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin didn’t hold back in a scathing message issued Friday that linked Russian President Vladimir Putin to the cyber threat. ”Vermonters and all Americans should be both alarmed and outraged that one of the world’s leading thugs, Vladimir Putin, has been attempting to hack our electric grid, which we rely upon to support our    economy, health, and safety,” said Shumlin in a written statement.  Shumlin, a Democrat, called on the federal government to investigate and take action to prevent future attacks.   ”This episode should highlight the urgent need for our federal government to vigorously pursue and put an end to this sort of Russian meddling,” said Shumlin.   US Sen. Patrick Leahy,   said he and his staff were briefed Friday by Vermont state police about the development, which he called a ”direct threat to Vermont.” ”  Russian hacking is a serious threat, and the attempts to penetrate the electric grid through a Vermont utility are the latest example,” Leahy said.  ”This is beyond hackers having electronic joyrides    this is now about trying to access utilities to potentially manipulate the grid and shut it down in the middle of winter.” A US government official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Saturday it’s not yet known ”the full scope or intent, or if this was an isolated event or not.” After weeks of   accusations about Russian hacking around the US election, the White House announced plans Thursday to expel 35 Russian diplomats    giving them and their families 72 hours to leave the country    and shuttering a pair of Russian compounds in New York and Maryland used by officials, in theory, for recreational purposes. The Russian government has denied the hacking allegations. The DHS and the FBI made a   report public Thursday with information about the malware code    which was found on Democratic National Committee computers    and urged entities to check for it. Targets? ’Government, think tanks, universities’ The report said activity by Russian civilian and military intelligence services is ”part of an ongoing campaign of   operations directed at the US government and its citizens.” Russian operations went after ”government organizations, critical infrastructure entities, think tanks, universities, political organizations, and corporations,” according to the report.  The hackers sent fake emails, texts and other messages attempting to get US users to click on malicious links, US officials have said. Some links led users to download the malware while others prompted people to change their passwords, which the hackers could then use.  A US official who wanted to remain anonymous told CNN that the Obama administration sought to alert utilities and other entities in the United States and abroad to the malicious activity so they could better secure their networks. In December 2015, Ukraine was struck by a massive cyberattack that cut power to 103 cities and towns and affected 186 more. The attack involved a team of sophisticated hackers who targeted six power companies at the same time, US officials briefed on an investigation into the attack told CNN in February.  Destructive malware wrecked computers and wiped out sensitive control systems for parts of the Ukraine power grid, making it more difficult for technicians to restore power. The attack raised major concerns because the US power grid and other major industrial facilities have many of the same vulnerabilities that were exploited in the Ukraine attack, US officials told CNN. In February, Elizabeth   the Obama administration’s deputy energy secretary, accused Russia of being behind the cyberattack.  Other top US intelligence and security officials said then that the evidence wasn’t conclusive enough to tie the Russian government to the attack."
31593,31602,50368,Roberts praises lower court judges in annual SCOTUS report,CNN,Ariane de Vogue,12/31/16,2016,12,," (CNN) Chief Justice John Roberts devoted his annual report on the state of the judiciary Saturday to the role of lower court judges who he called ”selfless, patriotic and brave individuals.” ”This is no job for impulsive, timid or inattentive souls,” Roberts wrote in the report, which sheds light each year on an issue the chief justice believes should receive the public’s attention. Roberts’ message comes as   Donald Trump prepares to fill a Supreme Court vacancy and reshape the lower courts. There are currently more than a hundred vacancies at the district and appellate court level nationwide, according to the administrative office of the US courts. In past years, the chief’s reports have emphasized issues such as judicial pay, budget cuts and recusal rules. Roberts, a keen student of the history of the Supreme Court, almost always manages to weave in historical references. This year’s report details George Washington’s role in appointing 13 original United States district judges, a list that included a general in the Revolutionary War, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and a poet and musician. ”These individuals are not well known in our era, but they launched the new system of United States District Courts and set the course for the important role those institutions would come to play in the new republic,” Roberts wrote. Turning to present day judges, Roberts said that they are not often the focus of public attention but that they play a ”crucial role.” ”You might be asking,” Roberts wrote, ”why any lawyer would want a job that requires long hours, exacting skill and intense devotion    while promising high stress, solitary confinement and guaranteed criticism.”  Roberts continued: ”The answer lies in the rewards of public service.” Congress has authorized 673 district court judgeships. Although Roberts said that ”unlike politicians, they work largely outside of the public eye,” he did not mention the fact that sometimes district court judges find themselves in the middle of a political storm, as when district court Judge Andrew S. Hanen of the Southern District of Texas temporarily stopped the Obama administration’s executive actions on immigration in 2015.  The programs at issue never did go into effect after a deadlocked Supreme Court blocked them earlier this year. On the current court, only Justice Sonia Sotomayor has served as a district court judge. Trump’s list of 21 potential Supreme Court nominees is dominated by appellate court judges and state Supreme Court justices but it also includes Judge Amul Thapar of the Eastern District of Kentucky, the home state of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell."
31594,31603,50369,Former student charged in teacher’s death,CNN,Shachar Peled,12/28/16,2016,12,," (CNN) A    man who as a high school student fathered a child with his teacher has been indicted on undisclosed charges related to the killing of the teacher and their son, according to a Manhattan district attorney spokesman. The bodies of Felicia Barahona, 36, and her    son, Miguel, were found Monday in Barahona’s upper Manhattan apartment.  Barahona, unconscious and unresponsive on her living room floor, had a telephone cord wrapped around her neck. The child was discovered underwater in a bathtub. Both were pronounced dead at the scene, police said. Isaac Duran Infante, whose relationship with Barahona five years ago while he was a student and she was a teacher led to her being fired, was arrested Tuesday.  ”He admitted to us he went there because of that, to end the life of Felicia Barahona,” Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce told reporters Wednesday, referring to the suspect. ”While he was there he decided to kill his son as well.” Infante told police he felt antagonized by Barahona, who he said dressed the child in girls’ clothing, Boyce said. Another possible motive involved ”monetary issues,” according to Boyce.  He had been arraigned Wednesday without entering a plea and was ordered held without bail, said his lawyer, Allen Farbman.  Barahona died from strangulation and Miguel of asphyxia, according to Julie Bolcer of the New York chief medical examiner’s office. A 911 call from the building superintendent brought police to the apartment Monday. The tragedy came more than four years after Barahona’s dismissal, after her relationship with Infante was discovered. DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx terminated her teaching position in 2012, saying she had invited a high school student to her home multiple times since late 2011. The sexual relationship with the student resulted in her pregnancy, a Special Commissioner of Investigation for the New York City School District (SCI) report shows.   The SCI report, released in 2012, never identified the student by name. Police investigators this week confirmed that Infante was the student and the father of Barahona’s child.  The 2012 report stated that teacher and student had sexual encounters about five times a week and the student eventually moved in with her in January 2012. The report was specific in its details: ”When he tried to use a condom, Barahona told him that she did not like condoms and not to worry,” it said. The SCI report also said Barahona planned to marry him and had bought wedding rings before they ended the relationship.  The report mentions Barahona had a younger daughter when she met Infante. According to the report, he did ”not get along” with her daughter, one of the reasons for their breakup. Other reasons included Infante drinking alcohol in Barahona’s apartment and his intentions to take the baby he had fathered to visit his family, according to the report."
31595,31604,50370,"Liverpool beats Manchester City, Chelsea equals EPL record",CNN,,12/31/16,2016,12,," (CNN) Chelsea registered a   13th successive victory Saturday, as Liverpool fought to a   win over rivals Manchester City to stay in touch with the English Premier League leaders. It’s Antonio Conte’s Chelsea that heads into the New Year top of the table after a     victory over a spirited Stoke City. Later in the day, Liverpool got the better of City thanks to Georginio Wijnaldum’s   goal. READ: Football team equals record winning run, All of which mean Chelsea leads   Liverpool by six points as it bids to win its fifth English championship, with City four points behind Jurgen Klopp’s side. Having twice taken the lead only to be pegged back by Stoke, Chelsea’s superiority eventually shone through as it powered to three points thanks in part to a brace from Willian and a late goal from striker Diego Costa. But Klopp’s Liverpool responded with a crucial victory of its own. Dutch midfielder Wijnaldum’s powerful early header from Adam Lallana’s cross was enough to leave Pep Guardiola’s City 10 points adrift of Chelsea. ”We were not cool enough in possession,” Klopp told BT Sport, ”but they (City) couldn’t create real chances because we defended so well.  ”It’s not about having a philosophy, but adapting to the opponent. We don’t want to show how good we are, we want the three points.” Meanwhile Conte congratulated his players after their latest win. ”To win 13 games in a row in this league is very difficult,” Chelsea’s manager told BBC Sport. ”Now, it’s important to celebrate the arrival of the new year, then to think of the next game against Tottenham,” added Conte referring to Chelsea’s next game on Wednesday when his team will seek a 14th consecutive Premier League win. Arsenal had set the record for 13 Premier League wins in a row during the   season. Arsene Wenger’s team won 14 consecutive league matches between February and August 2002. ”Numbers are not important if you do not win the title,” said Conte. ”Now, they are fantastic and we are proud, but we must concentrate on the second part of the season.” Manchester United’s slim title hopes were maintained thanks to a   defeat of Middlesbrough at Old Trafford, though Jose Mourinho’s side are 13 points behind Chelsea. After falling behind to Grant Leadbitter’s   goal, Mourinho’s team recovered thanks to late goals from Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba. United’s Portuguese manager credited his team’s recovery to the fans, who he claimed played a crucial role in a comeback win that leaves United sixth.  ”In the last 20 minutes, the fans were on the pitch    they were not in the stands,” Mourinho told reporters. ”And this is a credit to the players who showed amazing character to go and go and go and go.”"
31596,31605,50371,Greek ambassador to Brazil killed,CNN,Marilia Brocchetto,12/31/16,2016,12,," (CNN) Police contend Greece’s ambassador to Brazil was killed by his wife’s lover    a military police officer    and the widow is being questioned in the crime, Brazil’s   Agencia Brasil news agency reported Saturday. Chief Evaristo Pontes, a police investigator in the Baixada Fluminense region, said Friday that Sergio Gomes Moreira Filho claimed he killed the ambassador in   and then recruited his cousin to help dispose of the body, Agencia Brasil News reported.  Ambassador Kyriakos Amiridis, 59, had been missing since Monday, Pontes said. A burned car with Amiridis’ charred body inside was found in Nova Iguaçu, a town outside Rio de Janeiro, on Thursday, he said. ”He (Moreira) says he got into a physical fight with the ambassador, and he had no choice other than to hit the ambassador and kill him,”  Pontes said. ”He says he was in desperation and didn’t know what to do, given what had happened, so he asked a cousin for help and they went to make the ambassador’s body disappear.” Besides Moreira, the ambassador’s widow, Francoise De Souza Oliveira, and the officer’s cousin, Eduardo Moreira de Melo, are also being questioned, Pontes said.  Pontes said investigators think Oliveira ordered the killing. No charges have been filed. ”She only told us that her lover    let’s call him that    the military policeman, was the author of the crime, executed this crime against her husband,” Pontes said. ”She denies taking part.” Agencia Brasil reported the officer killed Amiridis inside the ambassador’s home in Nova Iguaçu. The officer and his cousin wrapped the body in carpet and put it inside a car, Agencia Brasil reported. Pontes said the cousin told police Moreira offered ”to pay him 80, 000 reals (about $24, 574) 30 days after the crime, a period after which they thought there wouldn’t be any more problems.” ”All are under temporary arrest for 30 days for the ambassador’s death,” Pontes said. ” As we said before, this was a tragic, cowardly act.” Amiridis had lived in Brasilia, the capital, since being appointed ambassador in January but usually spent holidays in the house outside Rio, where he was   from 2001 to 2004, Agencia Brasil said. The news agency said Oliveira was Brazilian. Speaking to reporters outside the police station, Francisco Oliveira, the widow’s brother, said the couple ”did not fight,” reported Agence   (AFP). ”For me it’s like a dream,” said Rosangela Oliveira, her mother. ”I’ll wake up and nothing will have happened.” Brazilian President Michel Temer’s office issued this statement: ”In this moment of pain and sorrow, I offer, on behalf of the Brazilians, my condolences and solidarity to the government and people of Greece, in particular to the families and people close to Ambassador Amiridis.”  The statement says Brazilian authorities will investigate the incident thoroughly.  ”The Brazilian government reaffirms its willingness to collaborate actively with the Greek side, as it has done from the beginning,” the statement said. Greece’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement expressing its ”deepest sorrow” at the death of  Amiridis. ”The late diplomat served at the Permanent Mission of Greece to the EU, at the General Consulates in Rio de Janeiro and Rotterdam and at the Greek Embassy in Belgrade during the first phase of the war in Yugoslavia,” the statement said."
31597,31606,50372,Police kill suspect in PA trooper’s death,CNN,Azadeh Ansari,12/31/16,2016,12,," (CNN) A    man suspected of killing a Pennsylvania state trooper was shot to death by law enforcement officers Saturday, Pennsylvania State Police Capt. David Cain said.  Jason Robison was wanted in connection with the shooting death of Trooper Landon Weaver, 23, on Friday. Nearly 100 members of law enforcement    from game commissioners to FBI agents    participated in the search before troopers found Robison at about 10 a. m. Saturday near the shooting site in central Pennsylvania, Cain told reporters. Robison refused to surrender and threatened the troopers before being shot, Cain said. ”Faced with a deadly situation, troopers were forced to discharge their weapons,” he said. Weaver was investigating a ”protection from abuse” violation Friday night at a home in Huntingdon County when he was shot, Cain said, ”Trooper Weaver was interviewing the suspect inside the residence when the suspect gained access to a firearm and shot Trooper Weaver,” Cain said. On its Facebook page, Pennsylvania State Police said Weaver was ”tragically shot and killed while investigating a   incident.”  Weaver, who enlisted as a state trooper in December 2015, is the 97th member of the Pennsylvania State Police to be killed in the line of duty, the state police’s Facebook page said.  Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf offered his condolences in a statement released Friday.  ”Landon will always be remembered for his bravery, his sacrifice, and his willingness to serve,” Wolf said. "
31598,31608,50374,Rebel warning over Syrian ceasefire violations,CNN,Laura Smith-Spark,12/31/16,2016,12,," (CNN) Rebels in the Free Syrian Army have warned they will no longer adhere to Syria’s fledgling ceasefire if the regime continues to violate it, according to a statement seen by CNN.  For now, the ceasefire remains in effect despite skirmishes and violations reported by both sides, according to the FSA statement and Syrian   SANA news agency.  Airstrikes hit three villages Saturday in the Damascus suburb of Wadi Barada, an activist there told CNN. Two women were injured by Hezbollah sniper fire in another village, Abu Mohammad   the activist, said. A day earlier,   said more than 20 airstrikes were reported in the area, which is home to a major water spring that supplies Damascus. CNN could not independently verify the reports. Syria’s state news agency, SANA, has not reported on military activity Saturday in Wadi Barada.  The   Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Friday that regime forces faced strong resistance from Islamist militants near Wadi Barada. Rockets, mortar shells, On Friday, two opposition groups, the Syrian National Coalition and Syria’s High Negotiations Committee, claimed the truce was violated more than 30 times in the first 24 hours of its coming into force. SANA in turn cited the Russian Coordination Center, based at the Russian Hmeymim air base in Latakia, Syria, as saying Friday that ”terrorist groups” had violated the ceasefire a dozen times. ”Over the past 24 hours, terrorist groups breached the cessation of hostilities agreement in Syria 12 times in Damascus, Aleppo and Hama,” the SANA report said, with half of the instances occurring in Damascus. The report didn’t specify which rebel groups were allegedly involved but added that ”terrorists from Jabhat   targeted a number of towns and neighborhoods in Aleppo and its countryside with rocket and mortar shells.” Jabhat   is another name for Jabhat Fateh   the former al Qaeda affiliate in Syria, which was excluded from the ceasefire agreement as an extremist group, according to Turkey and Russia. The FSA encompasses a number of predominantly moderate rebel groups across Syria. The fragile nationwide ceasefire, brokered by Turkey and Russia, began early Friday. It is the basis for planned peace talks between the opposition and the regime to be held in Astana, Kazakhstan, in the New Year.  UN Security Council vote, The UN Security Council unanimously adopted a draft resolution on Saturday proposed by delegations from Turkey and Russia that backs the ceasefire arrangement in Syria. The resolution supports a peace process with Turkey and Russia serving as guarantors.  Russia’s Ambassador to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, said Saturday the resolution ”speaks to the need for compliance with a cessation of hostilities . .. in Syria and of a very important meeting in the capital of Astana. .. where delegations of the opposition and the government will for the first time meet face to face.”  The meeting backed by the UN in Geneva and outlined in the newly approved resolution is scheduled for February 8, 2017.  US Ambassador to the UN, Michelle Sison, lauded the agreement but asked for more transparency, saying, ”We are still learning more about this initiative, including details regarding its implementation.” ”In this regard, we regret that the annexes to the agreements, which outline the ceasefire arrangement brokered by Russia and Turkey in detail, have not yet been made available,” said Sison. The latest effort comes after previous ceasefire attempts by the international community crumbled.  A successful nationwide ceasefire hinges on many fighting factions laying down arms. Groups from Iraq, Iran and Lebanon also are fighting alongside the forces of Syrian President Bashar  .  Turkey and Russia previously said the ceasefire deal excludes groups considered ”terrorist organizations” by the UN Security Council, ruling out ISIS and Jabhat Fateh  . But alliances between different rebel groups make matters complicated. The Russian Defense Ministry said influential Islamist groups such as Ahrar   and Jaysh   had signed up to the process. But the Syrian army asserted that groups linked to Fateh   of which Ahrar   has been the most prominent, would be excluded from the deal. Weakened rebel position, The latest truce also follows several ceasefire agreements brokered by Turkey and Russia in the city of Aleppo this month. Most were broken, but one held long enough to allow the evacuations of tens of thousands of rebels and civilians from eastern Aleppo. Eastern Aleppo had been under rebel control for four years and had been choked off by the Syrian regime, leading to shortages of food and supplies for civilians.  The Syrian regime then gained full control of Aleppo, a major turning point that has limited the opposition’s military and political options.  The brutal civil war has raged on for nearly six years and killed an estimated 400, 000 people."
31599,31609,50375,Trump ditches press pool to play golf,CNN,Eugene Scott,12/31/16,2016,12,," (CNN)  Donald Trump ditched his press pool Saturday to play golf, the latest example of his break with precedent regarding the media covering him and his transition. ”He made a   trip to Jupiter. We weren’t aware and appreciate everyone’s understanding. We are in the home stretch of this transition period and don’t anticipate any additional situations like this between now and inauguration,” Trump spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham told reporters. ”We’ve really made an effort to provide as much access and comfort as possible over the past two weeks and are proud of the way we have all worked together.” A club member tweeted a picture of the   with himself at Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida, which alerted reporters to the  ’s visit. The Jupiter club is about a half hour away from his    club in Palm Beach, where he is staying. Trump’s motorcade was seen leaving the club around 2:15 p. m. ET. The press pool, a small group of journalists assigned to cover the president, exists to keep Americans informed about the president’s whereabouts. In the case of an emergency, the president and his team often relies on journalists to quickly relay information to the American people. Trump has abandoned his press pool several times since his election victory in early November. After ditching the press twice in a week, the White House Correspondents Association called the practice ”unacceptable.”"
31600,31610,50376,Skakel murder case: Court reinstates conviction,CNN,,12/30/16,2016,12,," (CNN) Michael Skakel could be headed back to prison after the Connecticut Supreme Court on Friday reinstated his conviction in the 1975 murder of a    neighbor. Skakel, the    nephew of Robert and Ethel Kennedy, had spent more than a decade in prison for the killing of Martha Moxley until a judge in 2013 decided he did not receive adequate representation in his trial and ordered a new one. On Friday, after Skakel had been free for three years, the state’s high court overruled the decision. ”Because we conclude that the petitioner’s trial counsel rendered constitutionally adequate representation, we reverse the judgment of the habeas court and remand the case to that court with direction to render judgment denying the petition,” the state’s high court said in its decision. One of Skakel’s attorneys, Stephan Seeger, told CNN he was just becoming aware of the decision.  ”We haven’t had time to fully digest the opinion at this juncture, but of course it’s a setback. We’re going to be dealing with other legal procedures that are available to avail Michael of any and all of his constitutional rights.” Skakel has always proclaimed his innocence. Moxley’s body was found in 1975 after a night of partying with Skakel, his older brother Tommy and other teenagers in an affluent gated community in Greenwich, Connecticut. Authorities said she was bludgeoned and stabbed to death a broken golf club was found near her body. In 2002, Skakel was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. In October 2012 he was denied parole, but a year later a judge determined that the case presented by his defense attorney Michael ”Mickey” Sherman was ”constitutionally deficient.”  Sherman told CNN on Saturday he felt the judgement showed his approach was justified.  ”It vindicates the decision I made throughout the trial,” Sherman said. ”But when you’re a criminal defense lawyer you have to be prepared do to everything you can to vindicate your client. I am willing to stick with that consequence.”  Sherman hasn’t spoken to Skakel since the trial ended in 2002, he said.  ”I feel badly for Michael Skakel. This revokes his bond and heightens the prospect he may go back to jail, and I think he shouldn’t have been convicted in the first place,” Sherman said.  Skakel was freed on bail in November 2013.  One of Skakel’s three previous appeals went to the US Supreme Court but in 2006 the justices declined to hear that petition. "
31601,31611,50377,Lake Erie plane crash: Police now searching for remains ,CNN,AnneClaire Stapleton,12/30/16,2016,12,," (CNN) Police announced Saturday they would begin a new search and recovery operation for the remains of the passengers from a small plane believed to have crashed in Lake Erie Thursday night. During a press conference on Saturday, officials said investigators will build a grid and identify the plane’s last communication. A team of divers and marine experts will extract the remains.   The plane was registered to a beverage company executive and is based at Ohio State University Airport, the airport’s director told CNN Friday.  The executive’s father, John W. Fleming, told the Columbus Dispatch that his son, John T. Fleming, was at the controls of the Cessna that went missing Thursday night after the pilot, his family and friends attended a Cleveland Cavaliers basketball game. ”The airplane is based at our airport, it left from the airport and it did not come home last night,” Doug Hammon, the airport’s director, said Friday. Also on board the plane were Fleming’s wife, Suzanne Fleming, 46, their two sons, John Robert, 15, and Andrew Thomas, 14, a neighbor and a neighbor’s daughter, the pilot’s father told the newspaper. John T. Fleming, an experienced pilot, was taking his family and neighbors to the Cavaliers game as a treat for the holidays, according to his father.  Fleming is president and CEO of Superior Beverage Group, according to his LinkedIn page. The US Coast Guard and its Canadian counterpart searched the lake Friday, but the mission was suspended at 7:30 p. m. spokeswoman Katelyn Waddle said.  Three adults and three children were on board the aircraft, US Coast Guard Captain Michael Mullen told reporters Friday.  ”At this point we believe it’s [members of] two families,” Mullen said of the missing.    The last radar contact with the plane came as it flew about two miles north of the Cleveland’s Burke Lakefront Airport, where it took off, according to Mullen.   The   Cessna Citation 525 was headed for the university airport in Columbus, Ohio, when it disappeared from radar, a Coast Guard statement said. ”The Coast Guard dispatched a helicopter from air station Detroit,” the statement said, adding that it had partnered with the Royal Canadian Air Force, which sent a   plane down to assist in the search. Coast Guard Cutter Bristol Bay is also on its way from Detroit to help, the Coast Guard said. The search operation was made ”very difficult” by   to   waves on Lake Erie, the Coast Guard said. Air traffic control reported to the Coast Guard at about 11:30 p. m. on Thursday that the plane had just taken off from Burke Lakefront Airport in downtown Cleveland and ”dropped off radar about two miles when it was over Lake Erie,” Coast Guard Petty Officer 2nd Class Christopher Yaw told CNN. The missing Cessna has room for up to 11 people, but the plane’s flight plan indicates it had six people on board, Yaw said. Ohio State University Airport, where the plane was headed, is certified for commercial service and serves as a research and teaching facility. The airport is owned and operated by the Ohio State College of Engineering, according to its website.  "
31602,31613,50379,UFC: Rousey’s comeback halted in first round by Nunes,CNN,Euan McKirdy,12/31/16,2016,12,," (CNN) Only 48 seconds after the opening bell, the comeback was over.  Ronda Rousey, the UFC’s   hope and the sport’s   athlete, saw her chance to redeem her November 2015 loss to Holly Holm.  But almost straight away that dream was shattered by a prepared, efficient and confident Amanda Nunes, the women’s bantamweight champion, whose defense of her belt was largely ignored in the   to the fight. ”Before I walked out, (my team) talked, and this moment was my moment,” said the Brazilian, who claimed her first successful defense of her July title. ”(Rousey) had her time, she did a lot for the sport. I thank Ronda Rousey. But right now, I showed I’m the champion and I’m here to stay.” The matchup was largely billed as the American challenger’s opportunity to regain some of the dominance she demonstrated for much of her career    right up to that shock defeat to Holm. She’s been away from the sport and down since that loss    even admitting to thoughts of suicide    and in preparation for Friday’s Las Vegas clash, she kept largely out of the limelight. Ronda Rousey returns to the Octagon. But for how long? Partisan crowd, At both the Thursday   and Friday night’s fight, the fans were firmly behind the former bantamweight title holder and their cheers in the arena Friday were supposed to brush the cobwebs off after a   absence and to restore the   fighter to her former dominance. Following her November 2015 title loss in what was arguably the biggest upset the sport has ever seen, and dropping to    Rousey retreated from the sport. This was supposed to be the night to put all that behind her.  But the current holder had different ideas. Latching on to a poor defensive posture from the California native, Nunes battered her opponent with  a powerful left hook followed by a series of powerful rights, ”the Lioness” relentlessly stalking her prey. ”I really trained very hard, I’m a dedicated fighter and I have my team behind me,” Nunes said. ”They’ve made me an amazing fighter. It’s unbelievable how American Top Team put me on another level.” Ronda Rousey keeps promise to attend Marine Corps Ball, ’Definitely one of my last fights’ Even before Friday’s   defeat, there were strong hints that the end of the Olympic bronze medalist’s career might be on the horizon. On Ellen DeGeneres’ show last month, Rousey hinted that retirement may not be that far away. ”Not that long, I’m wrapping it up,” Rousey told DeGeneres. ”This is definitely one of my last fights. Everyone better watch. The show isn’t going to be around forever.” Before her loss to Holm, Rousey didn’t just win. She completely dominated her opponents. In her run of 12 consecutive wins, some took less than a minute, such as when she took out Cat Zingano in just 14 seconds in February 2015. Back then, Rousey, using her vicious ”armbar” maneuver to neutralize opponents, looked unstoppable.  But those days are over, and while the official announcement hasn’t been made, Nunes is already looking ahead. ”Forget about Ronda Rousey,” Nunes said. ”Now she’s going to retire and go do movies.” Miracle at Leicester? Sporting upsets to remember"
31603,31615,50381,Latino leaders ask: When will Trump reach out to Hispanics?,CNN,,12/31/16,2016,12,,"Washington (CNN) Latino leaders around the country say they want to keep an open mind about Donald Trump’s presidency, but less than one month before Inauguration Day, many are disappointed he has not done more to reach out to them. Since his election, Trump has sat down with the likes of tech industry tycoons, football heroes and even Kanye West.  But Latino leaders say there’s an urgent need for Trump to engage with the Hispanic community following a wrenching campaign in which he harshly singled out Mexican immigrants and called for tough immigration laws. The   has not met with Latino organization leaders in any official capacity since winning the election, based on a review of his public meeting schedule. It’s a conspicuous snub considering Trump’s campaign rhetoric. He opened his White House bid in June 2015 by infamously labeling some Mexican immigrants as ”rapists” and accusing them of bringing drugs and crime into the US. He also pledged to build a wall along the   border, end birthright citizenship and deport all of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, though he has since backed away from several of those stances. ”It is unacceptable that he has yet to build a relationship with Latino and Muslim communities that he has targeted the most throughout his campaign,” said Hector Sanchez, the chairman of the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda. ”Communities that are now suffering because of the things he said.”   Brent Wilkes, the national executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens, the oldest Hispanic civil rights organization in the US, said that it is unprecedented that the organization has still not heard from the  . ”We have always had Democratic and Republican presidents speak to us. Him not speaking to the Latino community is dividing this country,” Wilkes said. Asked about whether Trump plans on reaching out to the Hispanic community, Hope Hicks, a transition spokeswoman, said Trump ”will be a president for all Americans and will continue to reach out to specific groups and individuals as his Cabinet takes shape and he begins to execute plans for his first 100 days in office.” But Wilkes said a lack of Latino representation in Trump’s Cabinet is another issue that concerns the Hispanic community. As it currently stands, with all but two of his Cabinet picks made, Trump could be the first president in more than 24 years to not have someone of Latino heritage serve in his Cabinet. LULAC says the Trump transition team has not returned its phone calls. Michael Cohen, a top adviser to Trump though he is not a member of the transition team, told CNN that it’s possible LULAC didn’t reach the right people inside the transition, and were they to contact him, he would answer their calls.  Cohen also insisted that Trump’s transition team is making an effort to reach out to Hispanic groups, but he was unable to provide information on which groups the transition team has met with. He also said Trump has future plans to reach out to the Latino community, but he did not provide details. ”  Trump doesn’t forget the groups that came out to support him,” Cohen said. ”And he does have plans to speak to the Latino community once he officially becomes president.” Javier Palomarez, the president and CEO of United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce    which endorsed Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton, over the summer    said he speaks daily with Cohen. He acknowledged that the chamber ”might not agree on everything” with Trump but has a shared stake in growing the US economy. And there were a handful of Latinos present for a November 20 meeting in which Republican officials and what NBC News referred to as ”Trump insiders” sat down in Washington with leaders from   Latino, Asian and Native American organizations. But Janet Murguía, the president and CEO of the National Council of La Raza, the nation’s largest Latino advocacy organization, said at a news conference in late November that Trump ”needs to reassure, or at the very least, address the fears of the communities of which he will now be president.” She added: ”  Trump, we need you to protect and defend all Americans and condemn the violence and hate being committed in your name.” Asked about racial tensions in the wake of his election, Trump told CBS News he was ”so saddened” to hear about threats and slurs hurled by some of his supporters against minorities. ”If it helps, I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it,” Trump told CBS’ ”60 Minutes.” But there’s more the   can do to heal the country and reassure anxious Latinos about their place in Trump’s America, Sanchez said. ”I am still hoping one day that we will have an open dialogue with the ” he said. ”We need to make sure that our voices are still heard and not forgotten in this new administration.”"
31604,31616,50382,Putin congratulates Trump in New Year statement,CNN,,12/31/16,2016,12,," (CNN) Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated US   Donald Trump, rather than President Barack Obama, in his annual New Year’s greetings statement to foreign heads of state and government.  However, Putin did convey his seasonal greetings to Obama, his family and the American people in a separate statement earlier Friday, while responding to the latest wave of US sanctions against Russia.  In his annual greetings statement, Putin expressed hope that after Trump is sworn in as US President on January 20, the two countries, ”acting in a constructive and pragmatic manner, will be able to take real steps to restore the mechanisms of bilateral cooperation in various areas and take their interaction in the international arena to a whole new level.”  ”Major global and regional challenges that our countries have confronted in recent years clearly confirm that   relations are an important factor in ensuring stability and security in the modern world,” reads Putin’s direct message to Trump, released by the Kremlin on Friday. Trump: Putin ’very smart’ Earlier Friday, Putin said Moscow would not expel 35 American diplomats in response to US sanctions against Russia, as had been recommended by the Russian Foreign Ministry, and would ”not resort to irresponsible ’kitchen’ diplomacy.” Trump responded with kind words for Putin, tweeting Friday that he was ”very smart” for withholding reciprocal sanctions on the United States, at least for the time being.  The Obama administration said its measures were in response to allegations that Russia had interfered in the 2016 US presidential election campaign. ”It is regrettable that the Obama Administration is ending its term in this manner,” said Putin. ”Nevertheless, I offer my New Year greetings to President Obama and his family.” READ: Breaking down the Putin, Trump and Obama spy games, Current, former leaders congratulated, In his annual greetings statement, Putin also congratulated Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister Theresa May, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Chinese President Xi Jinping, French President François Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, among others. Former heads of state and politicians, including former US Presidents George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush, former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, also received greetings from the Russian President.  Obama, however, was not mentioned in this year’s message.  Putin also congratulated Pope Francis, UN   Ban   UN    Antonio Guterres, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde and International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach."
31605,31617,50383,Kellyanne Conway’s husband on short list for top US lawyer job,CNN,Jeremy Diamond,12/31/16,2016,12,," (CNN) Kellyanne Conway’s husband could become the US government’s next top litigator. George Conway, a corporate attorney who is married to one of   Donald Trump’s senior advisers, is on the shortlist of candidates to be nominated as US solicitor general, two sources familiar with the process told CNN.  Bloomberg News first reported that George Conway was being considered for the post, which requires Senate approval. Conway, who is of Filipino descent, would be the first   solicitor general. George Conway declined to comment, but one of the sources said he would accept the position should Trump tap him to be the government’s top litigator. The other source said he has been interviewed by Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump’s attorney  . The solicitor general is the Justice Department’s   ranking official and argues cases on the federal government’s behalf at the US Supreme Court. Kellyanne Conway, meanwhile, was tapped earlier this month to become counselor to the president once Trump is inaugurated next month. George Conway is a partner at the corporate law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen  Katz, where he has worked for 28 years. He is currently a partner in the firm’s litigation department, where he has honed his talents in securities, contract and antitrust litigation, according to his firm’s website. Throughout his career, he has represented   clients, including the National Football League and cigarette giant Philip Morris, whom he represented in a successful defamation lawsuit against ABC News. Conway has already stood before the Supreme Court, arguing a case before it in 2010, Morrison v. National Australia Bank. Conway graduated from Yale Law School in 1987 after attending Harvard College. He also clerked for US Circuit Judge Ralph Winter, Jr. of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, who was nominated to the court by President Ronald Reagan. He was part of the team of lawyers in the 1990s who represented Paula Jones in her sexual harassment lawsuit against   Bill Clinton. He helped write the Supreme Court brief in the case that would establish a legal precedent for a sitting president to be sued in civil court."
31606,31618,50384,"Allan Williams, The Beatles’ first manager, dies ",CNN,Euan McKirdy,12/31/16,2016,12,," (CNN) Allan Williams, the club owner and promoter widely credited with the discovery of The Beatles, has died. The music impresario, who also supported the group through their earliest years, was 86. Active on the Liverpudlian music scene for decades after his association with the pop group ended, his passing was confirmed by The Jacarenda    a club he once owned and at which The Beatles played some of their earliest gigs.  ”Today is one of the saddest days in our history,” a post on the club’s Facebook page reads. ”(Williams’) legacy has allowed us to remain at the heart of the Liverpool music scene for almost 60 years and his memory will live on through every band that plays our famous stage. ”Allan, you will be missed.” The club also paid tribute to Williams via its Twitter page. Martin King, of The Beatles Story museum in Liverpool, also posted reaction on  the museum’s website. ”We are deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Allan Williams. Our thoughts go out to his family at this sad time,” King said. The Beatles Story website noted the influence Williams had on the group’s early development.  ”Allan played a significant role in the story of the Beatles. His involvement in the Beatles’ early years in Liverpool and onto Hamburg helped shape the band in to what we see and know today. He personally drove the van to take the young band to Hamburg, Germany in 1960, where they gained the vital show business experience that led to their emergence on the world stage.” It also notes that Williams was, earlier in 2016, given the Citizen of Honour award by the City of Liverpool. Williams’ death also was widely reported in British media Saturday. Attempts made by CNN to reach a spokesman for Williams’ family were unsuccessful. Early gigs, The Jacaranda connection has become part of The Beatles legend. Local media recounts that, in response to requests from the band to play the   shop, Williams required them to help redecorate, John Lennon and   Stuart Sutcliffe painting a mural in the ladies bathroom.  The band eventually played gigs there between May and August 1960, according to the Liverpool Echo. Williams, who wrote an autobiography titled ”The Man Who Gave the Beatles Away,” not only booked the band for performances during their very earliest years, he also drove the band, then comprised of Lennon, Sutcliffe, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Pete Best to Hamburg for an extended stay in the German city.  Hamburg developments, The Hamburg years, a series of visits to the port city from 1960 to 1962, honed their style and brought them to prominence, and eventually the attention of their longtime manager, Brian Epstein.  The Cavern Club, another Liverpool venue inextricably linked with the Fab Four, also posted its condolences.  ”We have just heard the very sad news about the passing of Allan Williams,” the famous club’s post reads. ”Sincere condolences to his family at this difficult time.” The loss of the iconic band’s erstwhile manager comes after their producer, George Martin, died in March 2016.

31608,31620,50386,Get ready for another year of global tumult,CNN,Stephen Collinson,1/2/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN) The political tumult that rocked the world in 2016 might be an appetizer for 2017. Crucial elections loom this year in France and Germany, where the same   backlash that produced Donald Trump and Brexit could offer an opening to nationalist leaders who oppose Muslim immigration and further erode the European unity that has been a signature of the   War II era.  The Middle East is spiraling deeper into the mire of fraying borders and sectarian disorder while violence in places such Syria is unleashing a tide of desperate refugees that is destabilizing Europe. Meanwhile, rising powers such as China, Russia and Iran are closely watching the developments to determine whether the convulsions in the West give them an opening to advance their own interests. Of course, the 15 years since the September 11 attacks have been dominated by war, strife and economic disruption. But what makes 2017 so unique is that America    long a force for stability    is poised to inaugurate one of the most impulsive presidents ever to walk into the Oval Office.  Far from acting as a brake against turmoil sweeping the globe, America under Trump could exacerbate it. Nicholas Dungan, an Atlantic Council senior fellow, said uncertainty about the   could widen divides in the transatlantic alliance, the bedrock of 70 years of Western stability. ”Donald Trump is in many respects the   Obama,” said Dungan, who teaches at Sciences Po, an international research university in France. ”With Obama, there was tremendous trust but very little performance. With Trump it looks like there will be a deficit of trust and a surfeit of action.”  World on edge, It’s no wonder that Trump has the world on edge, despite arguments among supporters that the unpredictable statesmanship he has previewed in the presidential transition could strengthen the US position around the globe by keeping rivals off balance. He has questioned US alliances that kept the peace for decades in Europe and Asia and suggested he will ”expand” the US nuclear arsenal. He has spent his transition feuding with spy agencies that concluded Russia interfered in the election. And he signaled to China that the taboo topic of Taiwan is on the table, casting doubt on 40 years of diplomatic protocol. The Trump effect could be all the more pronounced because the political equilibrium of much of the world has been upset, straining institutions and assumptions in international relations that have endured for decades. To judge how much has changed, and why the prospects of 2017 look so uncertain, it’s worth looking back a year. When 2016 dawned, Obama, fresh from an Iran nuclear deal and seeing Obamacare upheld by the Supreme Court had every reason to expect a Democratic successor would secure his legacy. Republicans were confidently waiting for an establishment champion to emerge from their primary to send Trump back to reality TV. In Britain, David Cameron was basking in a surprising parliamentary majority won in a 2015 election. Most    polls predicted the Remain camp would win a referendum on membership in the European Union. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel, Time Magazine’s reigning Person of the Year, was lauded for her moral example in embracing desperate refugees from the Middle East and was Europe’s undisputed leader. And in Italy, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi was readying a trip to the US to receive Obama’s blessing after harnessing hope and change as a successful political message of his own. Unthinkable happened again and again and again, But within months, the unthinkable happened    again, and again, and again. In a blink of an eye, Cameron was gone, felled by a referendum in which voters who felt economically and culturally dispossessed opted to leave the EU. Trump won the US election after a vitriolic campaign that tore at social, cultural and political divides and left the rest of the world confused about American power and identity. Renzi is history, crushed   by his own referendum defeat which dealt a second hammer blow to the EU. And Merkel, rocked by a   terror attack in Berlin, faces a fight for political survival in a fall election hinging on immigration politics and a right wing resurgence spurred by her open door refugee policy. In France, where Islamic terrorism has become more frequent, President Francois Hollande acknowledged his dismal approval rating and nixed a   bid. The best hedge against an earthquake election win in May by far right national front leader Marine Le Pen is France’s   election system that could unite opposition against her. A March election in the Netherlands promises a strong showing by far right leader Geert Wilders built on skepticism towards Brussels that is threatening the existence of the EU. Still if Merkel or an establishment rival prevails in Germany, and the hot favorite in the polls to win the French presidency, Francois Fillon, is also victorious, 2017 could be remembered as the year the populist revolt began to ebb. Adversaries mobilize, As the West reels, its adversaries are mobilizing. Russian President Vladimir Putin defied Obama’s predictions his venture in Syria would end in a quagmire. Now, he seems on the way to restoring the lost Russian influence that he watched ebb in despair after the fall of the Soviet Union.  In Asia, Chinese President Xi Jinping is accelerating that country’s accumulation of regional power and challenging US influence and allies in the South China Sea. A volatile President in the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, is trashing a prized US alliance. Trump’s rejection of a vast   Partnership trade pact has already empowered China and undermined eight years of Obama’s Asia pivot.  The instability and uncertainty makes the choices Trump makes once he is inaugurated in January especially crucial. Should the new administration follow through on the  ’s tough rhetoric on China and take protectionist steps that could incite a trade war, tensions in Asia could spike considerably. If Trump walks out on the Iran nuclear deal or infringes the Paris climate pact, he could send transatlantic relations into a spiral. Aligning the US closer to Moscow could also alarm European allies unless he makes a   defense of NATO on his first trip to the continent. Asian allies Japan and South Korea are nervously trying to work out what Trump’s campaign trail rhetoric means for crucial national security infrastructure in Asia. North Korea, meanwhile, is brewing what could be Trump’s first big foreign crisis with its race for a functioning nuclear arsenal.  In the Middle East, Trump’s vow to move the US embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv could light a match to   antagonism and put US Arab allies in a tough spot. Could Trump’s strategy work? Of course, there’s no certainty that Trump will plunge the world into a new spiral of instability. Major policy shifts can be disorienting, but they aren’t always negative. Every President’s foreign policy is in some ways a correction to that of his predecessor. So Trump’s spontaneity could perhaps be an antidote to Obama’s caution, which some critics said frittered away US power. Questioning trade deals, alliances and conventions could actually end up strengthening the US at home and in the world, Trump supporters argue. And just because the One China policy has dictated relations between Washington and Beijing for decades does not mean it should always be so, they say. Trump’s naval buildup, meanwhile, could reassure US allies who feel bullied by China. And in an era of strongman leaders like Xi, Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a    US President might keep American rivals off balance. Foreign policy often begins at home. And if tax cuts and slashing regulation ignites explosive economic growth, a Trump boom could help lift anemic economies in Euorope and Asia. Those who hope Trump will not upset the geopolitical apple cart also question whether responsibility will sober the  . ”There’s just a whole different attitude and vibe when you’re not in power as when you’re in power,” Obama said in his   press conference. ”What we have to see is how will the   operate and how will his team operate when they’ve been fully briefed on all these issues, they have their hands on all the levers of government and they’ve got to got to start making decisions.”"
31609,31621,50387,California earthquake swarm rocks New Year’s Eve,CNN,,1/1/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Dozens of earthquakes helped bring in the New Year around Brawley, California, but they are more of a curiosity than a concern, experts tell CNN. Caltech seismologist Lucy Jones said earthquake ”swarms” aren’t unexpected around Brawley    there also was a swarm in 2012    because the   region called the Brawley Seismic Zone lies between the large San Andreas Fault and the Imperial Fault. More than 100 earthquakes have hit the region this weekend, but most are too weak, under 2. 5 magnitude, to be noticed by people, said Donyelle Davis, spokeswoman for the United States Geological Survey.  Weak quakes can trigger a bigger, more dangerous quake, but Brawley, a city of about 25, 000 people near the Mexican border, is too far from the San Andreas Fault for that to be much of a risk, Davis said. ”This area may have produced the most earthquakes in the entire state of California, but they are small,” Jones said. ”If they happened a mile away  we would be concerned, but these quakes are about 30 miles from the San Andreas Fault.” Since Saturday at least 24 quakes have been 2. 5 to 3. 9 magnitude, according to the Geological Survey. Earthquakes of 3. 9 magnitude or less generally create little or no damage.  They are common in California. As of noon Sunday, the state had had 191 earthquakes in the past 24 hours and 7, 707 in the past 365 days, with the largest measuring 6. 5 in Ferndale, according to the website earthquaketracker. com.  Catastrophic earthquakes seem to strike along the southern San Andreas Fault about once every 150 years, the  Geological Survey said, citing studies examining the past 1, 400 years. The last time an enormous temblor on the fault struck Southern California was in 1857."

President Obama said he was following the precedent set by George Washington, who penned a farewell address to the American people over 220 years ago. Obama defends his legacy on Twitter, George W. Bush also delivered a farewell address in 2009 from the White House.  ”Since 2009, we’ve faced our fair share of challenges, and come through them stronger,” Obama wrote Monday. ”That’s because we have never let go of a belief that has guided us ever since our founding    our conviction that, together, we can change this country for the better.” President Obama has said that while he won’t weigh in on every issue once he is out of the White House, he would consider speaking up about issues that go to ”core questions” about American values and ideals.

31611,31623,50389,How Trump made hatred profitable for Milo,CNN,Ruth Ben-Ghiat,1/2/17,2017,1,," (CNN)”America’s favorite mischievous gay conservative,” is how publisher Simon  Schuster bills its newest   author, Milo Yiannopoulos.  The news that the Breitbart senior editor had received a reported $250, 000 advance for his book ”Dangerous” (to be published in March 2017) has set the publishing and literary worlds aflame (Breitbart itself is already calling it ”booklash. ”) For Milo (he goes by one name) is no ordinary writer, but a media figure who has made himself famous for his   extremist views.  Positioning himself as the defender of victimized white males, he goes after those he sees as their antagonists: feminists, people of color, and immigrants, cloaking his hate speech under the mantle of the right to free expression. He’s banned for life from Twitter (for his harassment of   actor Leslie Jones). So why on earth would Simon  Schuster give him a platform? Profit, for one thing. ”Dangerous” immediately went to the top of Amazon. com’s bestseller list on the strength of its  . The media opportunities generated by the publishing house’s parent company, CBS, will likely compensate for any boycotts that materialize (the Chicago Review of Books has announced it would not review any Simon  Schuster books in 2017 as a protest and others, from indie booksellers to celebrities, are talking about boycotts). There’s also the issue of freedom of speech. Opinion is divided, even among liberals, about whether Milo, and his book, should be censored. Where are the boundaries about what’s fit for public circulation and who should decide or enforce them? This same debate arose last year in Germany on the occasion of the reissue of Adolf Hitler’s Mein Kampf, which had been banned in Germany since the end of World War II. For every reader who came away from reading it disgusted by the violence of fascism, the concern was that there could be others inspired by exactly that. In the United States, many of Milo’s fans are also supporters of   Donald Trump. Milo sees Trump the political disrupter as a kindred spirit. As he noted at the opening of the art show #DaddyWillSaveUs (during which he sat almost naked in a tub full of cow blood to honor Americans killed by undocumented immigrants) Trump’s ”Make America Great Again” has revived ”the dissident element in culture    punk, mischief, irreverence. ..” Such boosterism apparently made Milo a good fit for Simon  Schuster’s Threshold imprint, which publishes not only Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh but also Trump himself (most recently ”Great Again: How to Fix our Crippled America”). By signing Milo’s ”Dangerous,” the publishing house simply makes more evident what Trump’s campaign already proved: for today’s GOP, racist rhetoric has become normal political discourse. The risk that hateful rhetoric could become an inspiration for rather than a deterrent against hateful action is particularly relevant in Milo’s case, since his behavior raises the question of the link between dangerous speech online and    actions    a connection that came up repeatedly during our recent Presidential campaign.  Milo is above all a performer who lives for the attention    in the form of outrage    his theater of bigotry brings. At the University of Wisconsin (a stop on his ”Dangerous Faggot” college campus tour) Milo harassed a transgender student in person at DePaul University, he claimed he had had sex with the brothers of his black female protesters and called for their arrest. Nothing’s off limits to Milo, and his fans like it that way. And this is the real storyline of Milo’s book deal: far from being ”mischievous,” Milo is a barometer for the far rightward shift and expansion of the conservative movement in America to elevate figures that traffic in violent speech.  In fact, if we look closely, Milo and Trump have more in common than one might think. Both have outsized egos and platforms but have chosen to target ordinary citizens on Twitter, leading in some cases to their followers issuing threats to their targets’ safety (including rape, if that target is a woman).  Both mock those who are ”different” (Trump, the disabled Milo, transgender people). Both are longstanding misogynists. Both continually test their audiences to see what they can get away with and believe the rules won’t apply to them.  A year ago, Trump told the press what he thought of the immunity granted him by his own popularity: ”I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and I wouldn’t lose voters.” And Milo had this to say in the wake of his book deal: ”I’m more powerful, more influential and more fabulous than ever before, and this book is the moment Milo goes mainstream. Social justice warriors should be scared    very scared.”    So while Milo may seem a unique figure, in reality he merely serves up, with the flash of excess and a British accent, the attitudes toward people of color and women that marked the Trump campaign.  Lest you doubt that, listen to Milo, and then revisit the videos of Trump’s campaign rallies. See the faces contorted with hatred, and listen to the chants wishing violence on his opponent, Hillary Clinton. Watch as Trump supporters whose skin is too dark for the crowd’s liking are manhandled and ejected, as happened in North Carolina and elsewhere. We can debate endlessly the logic or morality of Simon  Schuster’s giving Milo a lucrative deal, but ultimately the responsibility for the climate that made this professional hater a bankable figure is the GOP’s, and Trump’s, own."
31612,31624,50390,Istanbul attack: ISIS claims nightclub shooting killer still at large,CNN,Euan McKirdy,1/2/17,2017,1,,"Istanbul (CNN) ISIS claimed responsibility for the New Year’s attack at Istanbul’s Reina nightclub that left 39 people dead, but authorities are still scrambling to find the killer.  ISIS’ claim, made in a statement posted to Twitter, cannot be independently verified by CNN. But it boasted about the first major terrorist attack of 2017.  ”In continuation of the blessed operations which ISIS carries out against Turkey, a soldier of the brave caliphate attacked one of the most popular nightclubs while Christians were celebrating their holiday,” the statement read. Both Turkish and US officials have called the attack an act of terrorism.  Here’s the latest on the investigation, the victims and why Turkey keeps getting targeted:   The investigation, Investigators have found the fingerprints of the suspect and know what he looks like, Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said Monday.  Eight people have been detained in connection with the attack, Kurtulmus said, but the suspect was not among them.  ”We will find him, no delay,” Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said. Footage of the attacker showed him shooting a security guard and police officer at the entrance of the nightclub. Turkish authorities said they believe he carried out the attack alone. Earlier Monday, the militant Kurdistan Worker’s Party, or PKK, distanced itself from the attack.  ”No Kurdish forces have anything to do with this attack,” the PKK said. ”The Kurdish freedom fight is also the fight for democratization of Turkey. That’s why we won’t target innocent and civilian people.” The victims, Those killed in the attack were from 14 countries, including India, Morocco, Jordan, Canada, Russia, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Security guard Fatih Cakmak was one of the first victims killed. He had considered himself lucky after surviving a December attack outside Istanbul’s Vodafone Arena, where he was also working security.   ”He went to work, and now he’s gone,” said his father, Hassan Cakmak, who said he can’t believe he survived his    son. Lubna Ghaznawi, a young female entrepreneur from Saudi Arabia, was also killed. The    worked   as a communications manager for one of Saudi Arabia’s largest banks and also   a   with her sister called Exclusave Card, the first student discount card in Saudi Arabia. ”She was an optimist and loved going to new places,” her friend Seham   told CNN. ”Laughter and happiness filled whatever place she went to.”  Dozens of people were hospitalized. As of Monday, 46 were still being treated, including one American, according to the Istanbul governor’s office. A handful of the injured were in critical condition. ’We were having fun’ Witnesses described how the festive evening turned into a bloodbath. ”We were having fun. At first we thought it was a fight, then there was a lot of gunfire,” witness Yunus Turk told CNN. ”After the gunfire everyone started to run toward the terrace. We ran as well. There was someone next to me who was shot and fell on the floor. We ran away and hid under the sofas.”  READ: International community mourns Turkey attack victims, Another witness said he didn’t know how many attackers there were, but he saw one person and hid.  ”I got shot in the f****** leg, man,” he told journalists as he was taken into an ambulance. ”These crazy people came in shooting everything.” On Sunday, the club issued a statement on its Facebook page. ”This terrible incident is a terror attack against our citizens’ peace, brotherhood, serenity, economy, tourism and against our nation,” the statement read.  ”Our hearts bleed and the bullets are in our heart.”  Why Turkey keeps getting targeted, Turkey’s deputy prime minister said he believes the attack was committed in response to Operation Euphrates Shield, Turkey’s ground operation against ISIS in Syria.  But the country is ”fighting a   war    against the Kurdish Workers’ Party, and against the Islamic State,” CNN intelligence and security analyst Bob Baer said.  Turkey shares a   ( ) border with Syria, making it relatively easy for ISIS fighters and supplies to cross.  ”That border is so porous    weapons, explosives, people coming across it,” Baer said.  Both ISIS and Kurdish militants have launched attacks in Turkey, which is also reeling from a bloody and failed military coup in July. Officials suspect ISIS was responsible for the attack on Ataturk Airport in June that left 44 people dead and an explosion at an August wedding that killed at least 54 people. ISIS has typically refrained from claiming responsibility for attacks in Turkey to create ”an environment of suspicion in Turkish politics,” analyst Soner Cagaptay wrote for CNN last year.   So ISIS’ claim of responsibility for Sunday’s nightclub attack could mark a turning point.  ”I think with Istanbul, it’s a declaration of war on Turkey,” Baer said.  Meanwhile, Turkish security forces clash almost daily with rebel PKK militants, mostly in predominantly Kurdish parts of southeastern Turkey. In December, a pair of bombings in Istanbul killed 44 people and wounded 155 others in an attack by a breakaway group of the PKK. The two explosions occurred after a heavily attended soccer game at Besiktas Vodafone Arena. Also in December, a car bomb exploded near a public bus, killing 13 soldiers in the central province of Kayseri. Three days later, a gunman assassinated Russia’s ambassador to Turkey at an Ankara art gallery.  ’The issue of a copycat’ So how could the attack at the Reina nightclub have implications elsewhere?  Since the assailant used a gun, and apparently started by killing the security guard, a similar attack could happen anywhere, CNN senior law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes said.  ”You have the issue of a copycat,” he said. ”So here in the United States,  we have over 300 million guns at large in our population. So we’re talking about one person getting a hold of one of those guns and launching an attack and doing it on his own. . .. So it’s almost impossible to stop, if that’s what we end up with    a lone wolf who wants to get a gun.”"

We hope one of your resolutions is to keep reading about the 5 things you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. 1. Istanbul nightclub attack, ISIS says it is responsible for the New Year’s attack on a nightclub that killed 39 people. A gunman burst into the club and opened fire about an hour after revelers had counted down the new year. Then he fled into the night. Turkish officials have started a massive manhunt to find him. 2. Chicago deaths, Chicago is more than happy to see 2016 go. It was the deadliest year in the city in almost two decades. There were 762 murders there during the year, with more than 4, 300 shooting victims. Police weren’t immune to the violence either. Attacks on cops doubled in the city in 2016. To combat the madness this year, Chicago plans to amp up its police force. 3. Russia hacking, Despite what everybody else    Democrats, Republicans, the intelligence community    says, Donald Trump’s not convinced that Russia hacked into last year’s elections. And since he knows ”things that other people don’t,” he’ll reveal his inside information either Tuesday or Wednesday of this week. Can’t wait.    4. U.

31614,31626,50392,Trump’s Russia claims drive this week in politics,CNN,Eric Bradner,1/1/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN)  Donald Trump claims to have inside information on Russia’s meddling in the United States’ election    and promises to reveal it ”Tuesday or Wednesday.”  At a New Year’s Eve party at his    estate, a tuxedoed Trump maintained that another culprit aside from Russia could have been behind the election intrusion. ”It could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don’t know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation,” he said. Liberal groups want delay of Sessions hearing, Asked to describe what undisclosed information he knew, Trump said: ”You’ll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday.” The latest developments in Trump’s denial of the American intelligence community’s assessment    widely accepted by both Democrats and Republicans    that Russia hacked Democratic operatives’ emails in a bid to help Trump defeat Hillary Clinton will be among the leading political stories this week, as Trump’s transition efforts resume and a new Congress is sworn in.  Here are five other political stories to watch this week:  Trump vs. the GOP on Russia, The Russia hacks aren’t just driving a wedge between Trump and the Obama administration.  Some Republicans on Capitol Hill are backing Obama’s moves last week to sanction Russia, and are calling for legislation to add even more sanctions on top of those announced by the White House.  The Senate Armed Services Committee, chaired by Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, will hold a hearing on cyberthreats and the   hacking Thursday.  The issue could set the tone for relations between Trump and the Republican majorities in the House and Senate.  New Congress kicks off, The newly elected Congress will begin its work Tuesday at noon with a vote to officially   Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan as House speaker.  Several new faces will appear in Congress, including Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and former Republican Florida governor and Senate candidate Charlie Crist, who is set to become a Democratic congressman. So will Florida’s Brian Mast, a Republican and Army veteran who lost both of his legs in Afghanistan.  An old face, meanwhile, will appear in the Senate. Vice President Joe Biden will be back in the body where he spent more than three decades to swear in new senators, including California’s Kamala Harris and Nevada’s Catherine Cortez Masto, who replaces retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid.  Hill Republicans eye busy first 100 days of 2017, The Senate will quickly move toward confirmation battles over Trump’s nominees    with Democrats complaining that nominees aren’t submitting materials they’ve requested, including their financial information and shouldn’t get hearings and votes until those are provided.  House Republicans, meanwhile, will condemn the Obama administration’s handling of a United Nations vote on Israeli settlements on the West Bank. And House Democrats are opposing a   rule change that would impose new fines for members who break rules of decorum. It’s an effort to stop Democrats from using platforms such as Periscope and Meerkat to     on the House floor, as they did last year.  Obamacare strategy session, President Barack Obama will make an unusual trip for a   president    visiting Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning to meet with congressional Democrats and discuss how to fight Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is set to push the repeal of Obama’s signature domestic achievement in the first week of the new Congress.  Democrats, meanwhile, face a defining moment in the early stages of the Trump era: If party members pledge not to help the GOP pass any replacement, it would place enormous pressure on Trump and congressional Republicans to come up with a way to keep 20 million Americans insured    and get Congress to approve such a program.  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi will hold a conference call with House Democrats Monday on Obamacare.  What else can Obama get done before leaving office? He’s still working toward closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and could make additional pardons. His farewell speech will also be formally announced Monday.  Filling out the Cabinet, After a holiday getaway at his    estate, Trump has several cabinet positions left to fill.  He’s expected to soon announce his choices for secretary of Veterans Affairs and Agriculture.  Other key roles remain unfilled, as well    including solicitor general, where top aide Kellyanne Conway’s husband George Conway is reportedly a candidate, as well as Director of National Intelligence and deputy secretary of state.  Trump to give deposition, Trump will attempt to conclude a piece of older business this week with a deposition at Trump Tower this week.  The deposition comes as part of Trump’s legal battle with the chef Jose Andres.  Andres was supposed to launch a restaurant in the new Trump International Hotel in Washington. But after Trump’s attacks on Mexicans as he began his presidential campaign in June 2015, Andres withdrew, and Trump sued him for breach of contract.

31615,31627,50393,"Mark Shriver to Trump: Don’t forget about children, the poor ",CNN,,1/2/17,2017,1,,"Chicago (CNN) As Congress returns and Washington readies for a new president, the leader of a children’s advocacy group’s political arm fears that vulnerable children and other   communities might have much to lose from Donald Trump’s agenda. Mark Shriver, head of Save the Children Action Network, expressed concerns with the policy priorities of the incoming Donald Trump administration  —   personal and corporate tax cuts, increases in defense spending, reductions in entitlements  —   and what it could mean for the vulnerable communities that have marginal influence in Washington. ”They don’t have political sway. They’re not making big campaign contributions,” Shriver told David Axelrod on ”The Axe Files” podcast, produced by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN. ”And when the cuts are made, they’re the ones who don’t have the biggest voice, and they’re the most vulnerable.” To subscribe to The Axe Files, click here. Instead of cutting programs for children, Shriver wants to see Congress recommit to initiatives like early childhood education, which has garnered bipartisan support at the state and local level and has shown results. ”Those first five years of life when 90% of brain growth happens, I think is the biggest social justice issue in this country,” argued Shriver, because poor children are developing at a slower pace than more affluent children for want of resources and a proper learning environment. ”It’s outrageous that we don’t do more as a country,” Shriver continued. ”I wish the leadership in Washington would see what’s going on in the states and make a commitment to our poor kids before they enter kindergarten.” During the conversation, Shriver touched on the personal impact that his parents  —   Sargent Shriver, the first director of the Peace Corps, and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, a driving force behind the Special Olympics  —   had on him. It was their Catholic faith and commitment to helping the poor and vulnerable that contributed to his decision to pursue a career in public service, Shriver says. While his commitment to public service never wavered, Shriver says that his faith underwent a test of confidence as he felt increasingly disconnected from the church of his youth and descended into what he called ”a Catholic funk.” Then Pope Francis began his papacy through very public and humble gestures of charity  —   asking for the blessing of the crowd at St. Peter’s Square before he blessed them, washing the feet of juvenile offenders, even paying his own hotel bill. Shriver could see that this pope was different, but he wasn’t certain if it was genuine. ”These are all gestures that kind of clearly caught my attention and made me wonder, are these publicity stunts in order to garner positive PR for the church, or is this guy the real deal?” Shriver said. He was determined to find out. Driven by a need for greater understanding of the roots of Pope Francis’s faith, and a desire to renew his own, Shriver set out to learn more about the new pope through his journey from Jesuit priest and reformist bishop in Buenos Aires to leader of the world’s 1. 2 billion Catholics, a remarkable path that he chronicles in his new book, ”Pilgrimage: My Search for the Real Pope Francis.” Shriver, answering emphatically that Pope Francis is indeed ”the real deal,” believes his power comes in part from his ability to challenge individuals to do their part to make our communities stronger and more compassionate. ”I think that’s why people respond to him,” Shriver said. ”Because great leadership, whether they’re political or religious, ask us to get beyond our self. .. And they inspire us to go into our soul and to try to make connection with our neighbors. Not build walls and isolate us, right? And that’s what great leaders do, and I think that’s what he’s doing.” Whether Pope Francis, who is 80, can build a legacy strong enough to withstand the more traditional elements within the institutional arm of the Catholic Church, is a question Shriver cannot answer, but he is certain that the Pope has already left a lasting impact. ”The way [Pope Francis] treats people on the fringes. ..he’s sending a message to all of us,” stated Shriver. ”I think it’s going to be hard to backtrack on that.” To hear the whole conversation with Shriver, which also covered the enduring legacies his parents left on the nation and on the wider world, why he believes politics and public service are still a noble profession, and much more, click on ”The Axe Files” podcast every week, subscribe at "
31616,31628,50394,Hill Republicans eye busy first 100 days of 2017,CNN,Deirdre Walsh,1/2/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN)”Buckle up” was the advice Vice   Mike Pence gave Hill Republicans about the hectic pace ahead for Capitol Hill’s first 100 days in 2017.  The   Congress returns Tuesday to begin an aggressive push on a range of policies that their new partner      Donald Trump    can help turn into law.  The focus in January will be to start the wheels in motion to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and vote to confirm many of Trump’s Cabinet nominees. There will also be debate about Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election    an issue the incoming President doesn’t want to focus on, saying last week it’s time to ”move on”    but many in his own party view as a serious threat.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is aiming to secure confirmation for many of Trump’s top national security and economic team members around the time he is sworn in on January 20. While Democrats don’t have the votes to block Trump’s nominees, they are signaling an intense fight nevertheless. They are planning to leverage the   committee hearings to draw contrasts with Republicans on key issues like health care, the environment and foreign policy. Obamacare repeal, ”Repeal and replace” has been the regular Republican refrain from virtually the day President Barack Obama’s signature health care law became law in 2010.  McConnell announced last month that the first vote of the new Congress will be to start dismantling Obamacare. The President isn’t going quietly. Obama is scheduled to visit Capitol Hill on Wednesday for a rare meeting with all House and Senate Democrats to ”discuss fighting GOP plans to repeal (the Affordable Care Act),” according to a senior Senate Democratic aide. The   visit signals that the President will be personally involved defending the law that stands as his most important domestic policy legacy. Now that they have a GOP president to actually sign legislation that rolls back the law, congressional Republicans are acknowledging that it’s complicated to simultaneously repeal Obamacare and put something else in its place. They control both the House and the Senate but they are limited because they don’t have 60 votes in the Senate to overcome a Democratic filibuster that would be expected on efforts to get rid of Obamacare.  Their plan is to use a budget process known as ”reconciliation” to wipe away the major planks of Obamacare. The Senate will begin debating a budget resolution this week as the first step. That allows them to use the procedure to pass the repeal in the Senate with a simple majority, avoiding an expected Democratic filibuster. Reconciliation rules do limit the items in the law that can be rolled back to those that have a direct impact on the federal budget, and Republicans still don’t have all the details ready on which ones they will include.  Democrats are preparing an aggressive public relations campaign to highlight how Obamacare has helped the 20 million now covered because of the law, and the other benefits they believe have occurred, such as better preventive care. On a conference call with House Democrats last week, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi touted that the ACA lowered costs and improved outcomes for millions. She compared the fight ahead against Republicans to the one she led in 2005 and 2006 when   George W. Bush traveled around the country championing a proposal to privatize Social Security, a plan that didn’t gain traction with the public or in Congress. Events in House congressional districts are planned for January 7, and Senate Democrats are also teeing up several events in Washington this week to remind people about the elements of Obamacare they believe are popular.  Pelosi, incoming Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders announced that January 15 is a national ”Our First Stand: Save Health Care” day of action for advocacy groups and Democrats to criticize Republicans for working to target the health care law, as well as other entitlement programs such as Medicare. While Republicans can pass the budget measure relatively quickly over a few weeks to begin unwinding Obamacare, the package that will contain the actual plans for repealing the law will take at least a couple of months to develop. Several committees in both the House and Senate will weigh in with their stamps on the details, including which taxes will go and which ones may need to remain in place until a new replacement plan is put in place. Democrats are also bracing for a big fight over funding for Planned Parenthood, an issue that has triggered multiple standoffs in the past with the GOP. It’s unclear whether Republicans will include a ban on funding for the women’s health care provider because of its role in providing abortion services as part of the initial budget bill. There is no consensus yet on when to address the issue, but conservatives are pressing for action soon and view the reconciliation process as the place to tackle it. Republicans are also struggling to come to consensus on how quickly they need to lay out their proposal to stand up a new health care system to take Obamacare’s place. Conservatives are insisting they limit any transition period to two years.   But GOP leaders are wary that once they begin unraveling the complicated federal and state programs now providing coverage, it will take three years or more to practically implement a new system. Multiple Republican aides say it’s more likely that replacement plans will be voted on in a piecemeal fashion over multiple years, perhaps even after the 2018 midterm elections, to ensure there are not major marketplace disruptions or economic fallout for insurers, states or the private sector. Confirmation battles, Trump’s transition team describes the mix of business leaders and former military leaders selected for Cabinet posts as a group of outsiders set to shakeup the way Washington works. Republicans are confident that they have solid support and will get help of many of the red state Democrats, like West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, to confirm them. So far, Rex Tillerson, the oil company CEO Trump tapped to serve as secretary of state, is the only pick who is raising some concerns with a handful of Republicans. They want more information about his close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin and how he will deal with myriad foreign policy issues where the US has tangled with Russia like Syria, Iran and recent cyberattacks.   Democrats are complaining that Tillerson, and many other Cabinet nominees, have been ”very slow” in providing information to the committees ahead of the upcoming hearings that committee chairs are targeting to hold in the second week in January. They are threatening to drag out votes on nominees if they don’t receive complete financial disclosure and ethics reports in advance of hearings so Senators can review the materials. Who’s in Trump’s Cabinet? ”Republicans shouldn’t expect their nominees to sail through if those nominees won’t provide the disclosure that past nominees provided and that senators, and the American public, deserve,” Matt House, a spokesman for Schumer, told CNN.  Any delay would just be symbolic, but if Democrats use the full amount of debate time allowed under Senate rules, then a vote on each nominee that would normally take place in one or two days could stretch out a week. That could mean it could take months to clear through all of the president’s nominees if Democrats decide to put up a fight, and other priorities like Obamacare repeal could also be delayed.  Democrats have been critical of virtually every person Trump has selected, but they realize they can’t wage war on all of them. In addition to highlighting conflicts Tillerson’s business dealings might present, multiple Senate Democratic sources say they are digging into the stock trades of Georgia Republican Rep. Tom Price, Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.   Under the law known as the ”STOCK Act” Price has disclosed information about his trades involving health and pharmaceutical company stocks. One senior Democratic leadership aide suggested they view the issue of conflicts arising from votes in Price’s post as budget chair coming around the time of these financial transactions as ”seriously, seriously troubling.” There is no evidence of any wrongdoing by Price. Phil Blando, a spokesman for Trump’s transition team, had previously told CNN Price ”complied fully with all applicable laws and ethics rules governing his personal finances.” And if confirmed would comply with the law, Blando added. Russian hacking, Obama’s announcement last week of new sanctions against Russia for its cyberattacks during the presidential election are putting Hill Republicans in a tough spot. Virtually all the top GOP leaders in Congress publicly backed the sanctions, although they criticized how long it took to put them in place, along with the administration’s overall foreign policy.  US intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia carried out a steady and deliberate cyberoperation targeting top Democrats email accounts and the Democratic National Committee.  Senate Armed Service Chairman John McCain,   is holding a Thursday hearing on the threat posed by foreign governments targeting US computer systems, including Russia, which will be the first public hearing since agencies revealed the links they found to Russia in the attacks. Get ready for another year of global tumult   McCain, along with South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, have vowed to draft legislation imposing additional sanctions to penalize Russia, and Democrats have agreed to craft a bipartisan proposal. Both McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan have publicly denounced Russia’s moves, but any bipartisan push to move sanctions legislation puts them in the precarious spot of using valuable time in the first 100 days of the new administration on an issue that puts them at odds with Trump. Floor fight over rules, Democrats are criticizing new Republican proposed rules governing decorum in the chamber of the House of Representatives. In response to a summer   that Democrats used to take over the House floor, GOP leaders are adding a provision to impose fines as high as $2, 500 for any member who uses social media application to broadcast activities from the floor. Some Democrats are calling the proposal ”unconstitutional,” ”a gag rule” and ”Putinesque,” but the changes are expected to pass. It’s unclear if a legal challenge could force the GOP to back down."
31617,31629,50395,Venomous ’Scorpion King’ scores wonder goal,CNN,"By John Sinnott, CNN",1/2/17,2017,1,," (CNN) A ”scorpion” is suddenly a new danger for English Premier League goalkeepers. Sunderland keeper Jordan Pickford was the first to experience the venom of a scorpion kick in Manchester United’s   win at Old Trafford on December 26. Henrikh Mkhitaryan connected with a cross that was behind him but the Armenian still managed to flick the ball with the back of his heel into the net. On Sunday it was Crystal Palace goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey that was left with a bitter taste in his mouth after Olivier Giroud produced an equally outrageous scorpion kick to give Arsenal the lead in a   win that kept Arsene Wenger’s side in the Premier League title race. Giroud attributed his goal to ”maximum luck.” ”It’s not difficult to say that is the best one, because I think I needed good help to score this goal,” Giroud told the Arsenal website. ”Thanks God, I was a bit lucky but it was the only thing I could do. The ball was behind me and I tried the back heel and obviously, after that, it was all about luck.” READ: Malaysian shortlisted in FIFA Puskas award, READ: Liverpool stay in touch with Chelsea, READ: Ronaldo’s $315M Chinese rumor, While Giroud admitted Mkhitaryan’s effort had ”maybe inspired” him, former Arsenal striker Ian Wright described the French international’s effort as ”the best Arsenal goal I’ve ever seen, the most beautiful goal an Arsenal player has ever scored.” Palace keeper Hennessey described Giroud’s effort as a goal of the season contender, though he was more prosaic in describing the beauty of the Frenchman’s strike. ”I just think he sticks a leg out and it hits him in the right area, but Giroud’s goal is up there for goal of the season,” Hennessey told the Croydon Advertiser. ”It’s the best goal scored against me anyway.” Arguably, it was a goalkeeper that produced the most outrageous incarnation of the scorpion kick. During an international friendly with England in 1995, Colombia goalkeeper Rene Higuita morphed his body into the shape of a scorpion to clear a cross from Jamie Redknapp with both heels. A scorpion kick goal    scored by Simon Skrabb for Swedish side Atvidabergs    is also on FIFA’s goal of the year award.

31618,31630,50396,How your gut’s circadian rhythm affects your whole body,CNN,,1/2/17,2017,1,,"We’ve known that bacteria live in our intestines as far back as the 1680s, when Leeuwenhoek first looked through his microscope.  Yogurt companies use that information in the sales pitch for their product, claiming it can help keep your gut bacteria happy.  The bacteria growing on our skin have also been effectively exploited to sell the underarm deodorants without which we can become, ahem, malodorous.  Until fairly recently our various microbes were thought of as freeloaders without any meaningful benefit to our functioning as healthy human beings. However, that view has changed in a big way over the last couple of decades. Interest in, and knowledge about, the microbiota has recently exploded. These highly diverse communities of microbes live in and on us in staggering numbers researchers now estimate that a typical human body is made up of about 30 trillion human cells and 39 trillion bacteria. We now recognize they’re essential to our health, participating in many important physiological functions such as digestion and metabolism of foods, and immune responses and inflammation disruption of the gut microbiota might then contribute to a variety of conditions including childhood asthma, obesity, colitis and colon cancer. Gut feeling: How your microbiota affects your mood, sleep and stress levels, New research is beginning to show that the composition and activity of the microbiota exhibits a daily, or circadian, rhythmicity, just like we do. This offers one pathway to explain a Pandora’s box of possible adverse health effects from aspects of modern life, such as eating late at night or too much electric light after sunset. The microbial daily routine, The microbiota is primarily bacterial but also includes viruses and eukaryotes like yeast the latter are much bigger and more complicated than bacteria, and have a structure similar to our own cells. The total DNA complement of the microbiota is termed the microbiome, and it’s what we study to learn about the inner workings of the microbiota. In this field’s early days, researchers took fecal samples from people to investigate the composition of the gut microbiome. Later they noticed that defining the microbiome from a sample taken in the morning was quite different from one taken in the evening: The gut microbiota was not static over the span of the day. Perhaps this was to be expected. Almost all life on Earth has an endogenous circadian rhythmicity that is genetically determined, but that also responds to changes in light and dark. For human beings, reliable changes occur between day and night in hunger, body temperature, sleep propensity, hormone production, activity level, metabolic rate and more. These findings on daily rhythmicity in microbiota have really piqued my interest because disruption of our circadian rhythmicity by electric light at night has been my research passion for several decades.  As scientists investigate the links between our internal daily patterns, electric light and health, new information about the rhythmicity of our microbiome might hold clues about how this all works together. The crucial question is whether the microbes simply respond to their host human’s circadian rhythm or whether they can actually alter our rhythm somehow. And does this really matter anyway? Microbiota calling the shots, A group of researchers from the Weizmann Institute in Israel have now used an array of remarkable DNA technologies to show that the gut microbiota changes location within the gut, and changes its metabolic outputs over the span of the   day, at least in mice.  Amino acids, lipids and vitamins that the microbes release circulate in the host mouse’s blood. As the levels of these molecules in the blood changed throughout the day, they altered the expression of genes in the mouse’s liver that code for many metabolic enzymes. What do the bacteria living in your gut have to do with your immune system? This is the first clear demonstration of the gut microbiota changing the circadian activity of an essential organ    in this case, the liver, which is the engine of our physiology and crucial to our health. The authors showed this link by administering an antibiotic to mice that kills much of the gut microbiota. Afterward they found significant changes in liver physiology. They could produce the same effect just by changing the feeding times of the mice mice forced to eat only during the day showed different patterns of microbiota metabolites circulating in the blood than those allowed to eat at night, their natural active period. In addition, the authors showed the liver changes how it responds to an overdose of acetaminophen over the span of the day in response to signals from the microbiota in the gut. They used acetaminophen as an example of a drug that could damage the liver depending on how it’s broken down. Interestingly, an overdose was less toxic at the beginning of the day, dawn, and most toxic at the end of the day, dusk. They concluded that the microbiota regulates how effectively the liver can detoxify over the course of the day. The authors argue that this finding can be extrapolated to apply to metabolism of drugs in general, including chemotherapeutic agents we use to treat disease. If so, then the time of day that a medication is administered could have a big impact on its effectiveness, and on the severity of its adverse side effects. This work has exciting implications. Understanding how time of day matters might allow for better treatment of disease, and for prevention of maladies like obesity, metabolic syndrome and perhaps other serious conditions. Technology drives the science, The findings described by the Weizmann group were made possible by advances in the technology of DNA research. As so often happens, scientific insights follow on technological development. This is particularly true in the science of DNA. In order to count trillions of microbes as well as distinguish among hundreds of different species, there are four broad requirements: conceptual development, sequencing machines, analytic approaches and supercomputers to conduct the near hopelessly complex statistical analyses.  Each of these has advanced to an extent that now studies like the one from the Weizmann Institute are achievable. Microbes: Our tiny crucial allies, The key conceptual breakthrough in analyzing the microbiome came with the recognition that the complex array of so many different organisms living together in a community may not be reducible.  In other words, it doesn’t appear possible to separate out only one bacterial species from the group, and understand how it functions in isolation. The community works as a whole.  For example, some of its members are bacteria that cannot absorb iron, which is necessary for growth. They require   molecules made by other members of the community to survive. So you can’t grow this guy in a Petri dish by itself. Gut and rhythm, The findings of the new study from Israel, which extends previous exciting work in this area, are relevant to humans for many reasons.  For example, people who must take antibiotics for extended periods, or shift workers who eat at the ”wrong” time of day, may be at risk via these microbiome pathways.  In both instances, there will be changes in their metabolism that could lead, perhaps, to higher risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome, both of which have been shown to be in excess in night workers. A root cause of these human health issues we see on the macro scale may be our gut microbiota and whether or not it is happy."
31619,31631,50397,"Pilot passed out in cockpit, police say he was drunk",CNN,Donie O'Sullivan,1/2/17,2017,1,,"London (CNN) A pilot who allegedly passed out in the cockpit of a Boeing 737 in Canada was arrested on suspicion of being drunk, police said. Capt. Miroslav Gronych was ”behaving oddly before he became unconscious in the cockpit” on Saturday, Calgary police said. The plane, with 99 passengers and six crew members, was scheduled to fly to Regina before heading to Winnipeg and Cancun, Mexico. Gronych, a    Slovak national in Canada on a work visa, was charged with having control of an aircraft while impaired. ”Initial tests conducted by police indicate the pilot was severely impaired by alcohol,” police said in a statement. Two hours after his arrest, the pilot’s blood alcohol level was three times the legal limit of . 08, Calgary police spokesman Staff Sgt. Paul Stacey said, according to CNN partner CBC News. ”It had all the potential for a disaster, but I’ll tell you this much    the likelihood of a pilot on a major airline like this actually being able to take off when they’re impaired like that is pretty slim, because there’s a lot of checks and balances,” Stacey said. ”There’s the other flight crew and there’s gate crew and they’re all about safety.” The gate crew noticed Gronych acting strangely and told the   who found Gronych passed out in the pilot’s seat, Stacey said. Budget airline Sunwing apologized for their pilot’s behavior and commended the rest of the crew for their diligence in handling what they described as a ”very unfortunate matter.” Sunwing said the plane took off a short time later with a different pilot.

The supplement in question was creatine, a favorite of weight lifters, typically purchased in flavored powders and mixed with liquids. Because this naturally occurring compound is involved in the body’s energy production, many athletes believe it helps them develop muscles faster. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Sports Medicine recommend (PDF) that those younger than 18 do not use creatine. ”It has been estimated that perhaps upwards of 30% of high school athletes are using Creatine,” said Dr. Ruth Milanaik, lead author of the study and a pediatrician at Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children’s Medical Center of New York.  ”In addition, the majority of teens using Creatine reported that they ’did not read the package insert’ and either ’didn’t know the dose’ they were taking or were purposely ’taking more in order to get quicker results,’ ” Milanaik wrote in an email.  Recommended by   of stores, Anecdotal evidence suggests that creatine may impair liver and kidney function and cause muscle cramps, according to the authors.  Creatine use may also increase the risk of ”compartment syndrome,” in which pressure builds in a muscle and prevents blood flow. Finally, the authors warn that dietary workout supplements, such as creatine, are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. ”Dietary supplements are regulated by the FDA    albeit not in the same way as pharmaceutical drugs for example,” said Lyndsay Meyer, spokeswoman for the agency. The set of regulations which guide the FDA’s oversight of supplements are different from those covering ”conventional” foods and drug products, said Meyer. Still, the authors claim that some supplements are adulterated, in some cases with pharmaceutical drugs, which might lead to adverse effects. ”A young teen patient of mine had serious medical side effects,” Milanaik said. ”After going over his medical record, on a whim I asked about herbal supplements. He informed me that he was taking Creatine that had been recommended by his local vitamin store to help him ’prepare for the upcoming football season.’ ”  Her patient ended up in a hospital, diagnosed with dehydration and other issues. Milanaik, with the help of    Princeton student researcher Maguire Herriman, decided to look at ”whether this was an isolated issue or whether this was widespread.” Were other local vitamin stores routinely recommending   supplements to unsuspecting teens? Posing as a    high school athlete seeking to increase his muscle strength, Herriman called 244 health food stores across the United States and asked the sales attendant what supplements he or she would recommend.  If a sales attendant did not mention creatine or testosterone boosters initially, Herriman would specifically ask about them. He also asked whether a    could purchase these products in the store on his own.  ”No sales person was coerced into recommendations,” Milanaik said. ”If a salesperson was willing to answer to our questions it can be assumed that   would give similar answers to actual teen customers.” Sales attendants at 164 stores (about 67% of the 244) recommended creatine. Of these, about 38% recommended creatine without prompting, and nearly 29% recommended creatine after being asked specifically about it.  Nearly 10% of sales attendants recommended a testosterone booster to the caller, though medical experts believe this too could be harmful for teens. Although it is not illegal to sell these products to teens, many have labels that say they are recommended only for adults.  ”Not only did we find that health food stores were making recommendations contrary to medical opinion, we found that they were actually ignoring age restriction warning labels on the product packages,” Milanaik said. She and her   found that just over 74% of sales attendants stated a    was allowed to purchase creatine, while slightly more than 41% said the   teen could purchase a testosterone booster.  An individual matter, Richard Kraus, owner of Health Unlimited, a health and natural supplements store based in Atlanta, says he has never encountered this issue with his own customers. ”I talk to a handful of people with athletic teenagers, but that’s never come up for that age group,” Kraus said. He added that, in general, older teens     over the age of 17    are more likely to purchase supplements or ask for advice. When that happens, his sales associates steer them to Kraus, since he is more knowledgeable.  ”I’ve read things and talked to different trainers,” Kraus said. He’s been in the business for many years but admits, ”I’m not a scientist, not a doctor, so I haven’t studied it in a lab or reviewed a lot of studies.”  Still, the creatine products on his shelves are sourced from ”reputable companies,” he said, with labels cautioning ”for adults only,” or ”consult your health care professional before using.” Kraus said he probably wouldn’t recommend the product to anyone under the age of 17 who wasn’t seriously into athletics.  ”In general, a    would be too young to benefit from it,” he said, adding that teens that age should concentrate on eating a really good diet instead. Still, Kraus sees supplementation as an individual matter, since some teens are more developed than others and some ”demand much more of their bodies and need different things to replenish themselves” compared with the average person, Kraus said. ”It’s not    .” ’Deception is necessary’ Though the study results serve as an important warning for parents, some might question the ethics of researchers constructing an elaborate ruse in order to gather information. ”Deception in research should be minimized whenever possible,” Milanaik said. ”However, there are circumstances where deception is necessary, and we believe this is one of them.” She added that she and her colleagues considered an alternative method of a   survey of young teens but decided such a survey would not achieve the objective of ”focusing on the quality of information provided by employees in stores specializing in sales of vitamins and supplements.” Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital, NYC, said that using an undercover approach to investigate selling supplements to minors is ”certainly justified.” Glatter had no involvement in the research. ”It only makes sense that this would be a rational and logical way to approach such an inquiry.” He added that he could ”attest to the dangers of creatine as well as testosterone,” because, while working in the ER, he has taken care of teens who have developed kidney and liver problems as a result of using such products. The American Academy of Pediatrics, which published the study, agreed that no matter its methods, the research was worthwhile. The journal Pediatrics ”publishes studies that are relevant to improving the health and wellbeing of children and adolescents. Every manuscript goes through   and an editorial board discussion prior to making a decision as to whether or not to publish.  The same process was followed for this study,” the academy wrote in an email. The study raises important issues for many people, Milanaik said. Health food stores might want to raise awareness among employees about   products so they can redirect teens to healthy diets, she said.   Meanwhile, pediatricians might raise awareness of this issue, both among themselves and among parents. Milanaik said she and her   hope their article will help physicians ”guide teens in making more educated choices about their health.”   Finally, both parents and teens might want to ”look at product labels before taking supplements and talk to their physicians if they have questions,” Milanaik said. ”It should not be assumed that all products in a health food store are ’healthy’ for all consumers.”"

The    entrepreneur was one of seven victims from Saudi Arabia who had traveled to Istanbul to attend New Year’s festivities, according to Turkish   news agency Anadolu.  The deadly rampage, later claimed by ISIS, was an attack on cosmopolitan Turkey. The target: a popular club frequented by wealthy secular millennials and international celebrities. Ghashwani was a communications manager for one of Saudi Arabia’s largest banks and also   a   with her sister called Exclusave Card, the first student discount card in Saudi Arabia.  A friend of Gashwani’s described her as a ”torch of energy.” ”She was an optimist and loved going to new places. . .. Laughter and happiness filled whatever place she went to,” Seham   told CNN. ”She was very ambitious and inspiring.” At least 11 victims were from Turkey, according to Anadolu, while at least 27 victims hailed from 13 other countries, including Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Canada. These are some of their stories: Leanne Nasser, teenager from Israel, Leanne Nasser, a Palestinian from the town of Tira, begged her parents to let her go to Istanbul to celebrate New Year’s Eve with three friends. She had never before traveled abroad. At first, her father refused to let her go. But an aunt, Layal Masarweh, intervened on her behalf.  ”Her father was totally against that,” said Masarweh, who helped convince Nasser’s father to let her go. ”He was saying that Istanbul is too dangerous and that she should not go at all. But she insisted, saying that nothing will happen to her.” Nasser, 18, had finished high school in June and had big plans for her future. She worked at a dental clinic and wanted to become a dentist. ”I cannot forgive myself,” Masarweh told CNN. ”I wish I was with her to defend her or do anything to save her life. I wish they took my soul and gave it to her.” Khushi Shah, Indian fashion designer, Khushi Shah was a young Indian fashion designer based in Mumbai. Shah had started her own fashion label, KhushiZ, and traveled to Istanbul for work three days before the deadly assault. Shah’s older brother, Akshay Shah, and her cousin Hiren Chawra were headed to Istanbul to identify and repatriate her body, Shah’s cousin Priyanka Shah told CNN.   Abis Rizvi, Indian film producer, Abis Rizvi, a director and film producer from Mumbai, was among the victims, according to the Twitter account of Sushma Swaraj, Indian minister of external affairs. ”We are extremely heart broken and devastated to announce the sudden demise of Abis Rizvi. May his soul rest in peace,” the film company Rizvi worked for posted on Facebook. Condolences poured in from Bollywood, with actors and directors sharing messages of grief. ”Devastated by the death of my friend #AbisRizvi in the dastardly terrorist attack this morning in an #Istanbul nightclub,” Bollywood actor Jaaved Jaaferi tweeted.  Pooja Bhatt, an Indian filmmaker and actress, tweeted: ”Devastated to hear that our friend #AbisRizvi was shot dead in the Istanbul nightclub attack. My heart goes out to his family. RIP.” Fatih Cakmak, 35, Turkish security guard, A Turkish security guard who was among the first to die in Sunday’s attack had narrowly escaped a double bombing in the city three weeks earlier. Fatih Cakmak had considered himself lucky after surviving the December 10 attack outside Istanbul’s Vodafone Arena, where he was working security for a soccer match. His father, Hassan Cakmak, told CNN he is stunned that he has outlived his son.  ”It was just a regular day. He lived at home. He went to work, and now he’s gone,” the elder Cakmak said at his son’s funeral Monday in Istanbul’s Bagcilar neighborhood. Ilyas Tas, owner of security company Favori Vip, posted two photos of his late employee and friend on Facebook, writing that he ”felt broken.”  ”When the attack happened last night, I heard it from other friends. I called Fatih till 5 a. m. and his phone was ringing, but he wasn’t answering. I was so upset. It really hurt me,” Tas told CNN. ”Fatih was really great at his job. He was quiet and calm. Everybody loved him so much. That is why his funeral was so crowded.”  Kerim Akyil, 23,   citizen, Another victim, Kerim Akyil, had dual   citizenship, according to Anadolu and Belgian officials.   Residents in the Belgian town of   gathered Monday for a candlelit vigil to honor Akyil, 23. Mayor Alain Yzermans posted a statement on Facebook expressing sympathy for the family.

31622,31635,50401, New Year’s resolution: Hold Russia accountable,CNN,,12/30/16,2016,12,," (CNN) It may not have been the dominant headline, but make no mistake    2016 was the year when mass atrocities against children became the new normal. Without a doubt, history offers up a multitude of moments when children’s rights have been systematically violated in the course of war. From the scorched earth of Stalingrad during the Second World War to Srebrenica during the Bosnian conflict, time and again children have been thrust onto the front lines of conflict. But during 2016, a year that was a total war on normalcy, the abuse of children’s rights was pushed to new extremes. From Syria to South Sudan, from Nigeria to Nepal, abuses have become so commonplace    and the world’s response so anemic    that the perpetrators of these atrocities have carried out their violent acts with impunity.  Our new year’s resolution for 2017 must be to bring the perpetrators of these crimes against children to justice, and then go a step further and show that never again will the world stand by as the rights of boys and girls are violated. Let us start by naming and confronting the reality that many violations in the Syrian conflict are borne out of military action taken by state actors. Russia is a member of the Council of Europe, and it has ratified the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR). Claims alleging human rights violations by ECHR Contracting States can be brought before the European Court of Human Rights. Given the evidence of Russia’s involvement in perpetrating atrocities in Syria, Syrian families have a forum in which they can seek accountability and justice for the wrongs they have suffered. In practical legal terms, a claim before the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) regarding Russia’s involvement in the Syrian conflict is one of only a few routes open to those seeking some semblance of    accountability. Last week, the UN General Assembly voted to establish an investigative body to ”collect, consolidate, preserve and analyze evidence” and to prepare cases on war crimes. But this initiative may be more symbolic than substantive since we know that no matter the evidence, no case on the Syrian conflict is likely to ever reach the International Criminal Court (ICC) as neither Russia nor Syria are members. And as long as Russia vetoes the only other route    a referral to the ICC by the Security Council    we can be certain that the victims of the Syrian killing fields will never find justice through such legal recourse. But we’ve been here before. In 2011, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic was established by the   UN Human Rights Council to investigate possible war crimes. At its inception, the Commission called unsuccessfully for the Syrian authorities to immediately put an end to all human rights violations, to fully comply with their obligations under international human rights law and heed calls for an immediate end to all violence in Syria. The Commission is now armed with a list of war crimes suspects. But while it has produced four excellent reports, plus four periodic updates exposing human rights violations in Syria based on interviews with over 1, 400 witnesses and victims, prosecutions have never ensued. The Syrian government has prevented the Commission from undertaking investigations inside the country. And while the Commission’s concern was extended to include investigations of all massacres, the Security Council could not agree on the Commission’s proposal to refer the Syrian case to the ICC. So even after the Commission’s next report to the   Council in February, we may still be at square one. If international humanitarian law has been found wanting, it is no time to forget the power of international human rights law, which has been built up over decades and which is reflected in the    European Convention of Human Rights. Its protections do not cease to apply in situations of armed conflict, and where there is an available forum, such as the European Court of Human Rights, it should be used to bring the cases of Syrian children who have been victims of recent attacks.  The Idlib school bombing of Oct. 26, which tragically left at least 35 children and teachers dead, would make for a strong test case. Most children died as they rushed for safety from the kindergarten, elementary school, two middle schools and secondary school that were part of a single education complex. But the targeting of the schools was no accident: at least six bombs were dropped despite the fact there were no military targets nearby. In the immediate aftermath of the bombing, Russia said it would support an inquiry. Attempts to persuade the Security Council to call Russia’s bluff failed. And when Tony Lake, the Executive Director of UNICEF, alleged that a war crime had been committed and there were calls for the Security Council to intervene, Russia claimed there had been no bombing at all. In the face of growing evidence of the use of   aircraft in the strikes    the planes typically flown by Syrian and Russian air force pilots    Russia has now taken a third line. They have issued a denial that Russian or Syrian warplanes dropped any bombs in Idlib at any time from October 17 to October 26 of this year. The ECHR can test Russia’s claims. This can be brought to trial if a Syrian family affected by the violence brings a case to the European Court. Of course, Russia may claim that before any action is taken in the ECHR, domestic courts must first adjudicate the matter. But by the same logic of strategic   that has led Russia to intervene in a foreign conflict, there is a good argument to be made for the ECHR to intervene on behalf of Syrian families highly unlikely to find justice in a Potemkin court. If the bottomless   of war crimes witnessed against children in 2016 has taught us anything, it is that we must ensure humanity’s common conscience is not just enshrined in our laws, but practically enforced when those very laws are broken. At the outset of the New Year we should resolve that when schools become military targets, we will not stand aside. When violations against children are brought to our attention, we will not just wring our hands. When children become weapons of war, we will not stay silent.  Only when we send a clear message of hope    that we are prepared to defend children’s rights at all costs    will millions of children begin to feel safe."

Capt. Miroslav Gronych was ”behaving oddly before he became unconscious in the cockpit,” Calgary Police said.  The    Slovak national was due to fly the plane, with 99 passengers and six crew members, from Calgary to Regina and Winnipeg, before flying on to Cancun, Mexico. He was charged with having control of an aircraft while impaired. ”Initial tests conducted by police indicate the pilot was severely impaired by alcohol,” police said in a statement. Budget airline Sunwing apologized for their pilot’s behavior and commended the rest of the crew for their diligence in handling what they described as a ”very unfortunate matter.” Sunwing said the plane took off a short time after with a different pilot."
31624,31638,50404,"Parent obesity may affect child development, study says",CNN,,1/2/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Being overweight may impact not only your health but your future child’s development as well, a new study suggests.  Children of obese parents may be at risk for developmental delays, says the study, published in the journal Pediatrics.  In the United States, an estimated one in five women is obese when they get pregnant, registering a body mass index above 30. The healthy average is between 18. 5 and 24. 9.  But few studies have looked at the father’s weight, even though 20% to 30% of US adults    both male and female    are obese. A team from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development set out to learn more. ”Our study is one of the few that also includes information about fathers, and our results suggest that dad’s weight also has significant influence on child development,” said lead researcher Dr. Edwina Yeung, an investigator at the institute. Effects differ based on the heavier parent, The researchers looked at 4, 821 children from 4 months old to the age of 3, between 2008 and 2010, and found specific effects on children, depending on which parent is obese. Compared with normal or underweight mothers, children of obese mothers were more likely to have difficulty using small muscles, such as those in their fingers or hands.  Paternal obesity was associated with increased risk of failing at   activities, such as feeding themselves, playing and undressing themselves. Those born to extremely obese couples also were more likely to fail   tests. Pinpointing progress, The researchers used data from the ongoing Upstate KIDS study, which follows over 6, 000 children born in New York state.  It aims to track the growth, motor and social development of children and its correlation with infertility treatments, obesity, rising maternal age and pregnancy complications.  Parents are asked to regularly complete the Ages and Stages Questionnaire for their children. ”The questionnaire is a screening tool. It’s an indicator of whether a child is on track for behaviors appropriate to his or her age,” Yeung explained. The tool was designed to pinpoint development progress and catch delays in children up to the age of 6. Yeung’s team looked at reports recorded by parents at 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months. According to Yeung, although parents are   information, the potential for bias is small, as questions are straightforward (PDF). ”The fine motor skills part, for example, asks such questions as whether the child can turn the pages of a book or whether he or she can stack blocks,” she explained. Mothers also completed a questionnaire about health status and lifestyle at enrollment to determine both parents’ height and weight before pregnancy. According to the study authors, factors associated with obesity    such as lower income and education, smoking and alcohol use    were taken into to consideration when analyzing the results.  Weight at delivery was taken from electronic birth certificates.  Cause remains unclear, It is not unclear exactly why parental obesity might increase developmental delays in children. ”Our study wasn’t designed to prove cause and effect. At this point, we only have correlations between parents’ BMI and children’s scores on a screening questionnaire,” Yeung stressed. However, the authors note that studies on animals show that obesity during pregnancy may promote inflammation, which can affect the fetal brain.  ”Obesity is correlated with a rise in inflammation and in hormones that regulate body fat and metabolism. One theory is that these hormones might influence the development of the baby’s brain,” Yeung said. Other theories are that high blood sugar or a shortage of certain nutrients might influence brain development. The study offers less information on the potential effects of paternal obesity on child development, but the authors cite previous research hypothesizing that obesity could affect the expression of genes in sperm. Scott Johnson, a professor in developmental psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles, was fascinated by team’s results.   ”The authors pose some interesting possible mechanisms by which maternal and paternal obesity could be responsible for the outcomes they reported,” Johnson said. He thinks the theories that maternal obesity poses a risk to a fetus’ development are sound but says much more research is required. ”It wasn’t clear to me how that general property induces specific deficits in fine motor skills,” Johnson said. The effects of obesity in male sperm are also not sufficiently explained, but the developmental psychology expert says it is not impossible. ”It’s not a crazy idea. It has been speculated for some time that there may be distinct paternal genetic contributions to autism risk, for example,” he said. What’s next? ”Overall, the study has some important findings and an intriguing set of possible explanations,” Johnson concluded.  However, at this point, nothing can be confirmed.  ”It’s really important to stress that these results need to be confirmed by other studies,” Yeung agreed. But that is not easy, as recruiting families and collecting and analyzing the data could take years. If the team’s results are confirmed, physicians who work with young children might take parents’ weight into account when screening for development. In the end, it’s one more reason to keep an eye on your waistline.  ”We know that obesity greatly increases the risk for such conditions as heart disease, diabetes and stroke. For anyone, male or female, pregnant or not, it makes sense to attain a healthy weight,” Yeung said."

The traditional list overseen by the UK government recognizes the achievements and service of ”extraordinary” people and 2016 certainly has been an extraordinary year for Murray. The    ended the season as world No. 1 for the first time, toppling Novak Djokovic    who had held the top spot since July 2014. Murray had a golden summer, winning his second Wimbledon title in July and then claiming his second Olympic gold at the Rio Games in August. Last, but not least, Murray and his wife Kim also became parents with the birth of daughter Sophia in February, just days after he played in the Australian Open final. CNN’s Open Court presenter Pat Cash says there is more to come from ”Sir Andy Murray” in 2017: ”One of my predictions is that he will be No. 1 for quite a while next year. He’ll be pushed but for the majority of the year he will be No. 1. Have your say on our Facebook page, ”I also think he’ll win the French Open. He’s desperate to win that one and I think he’ll grab it.” It was not quite the start to 2017 that Murray wanted when he lost his first match  (4)   to Belgian David Goffin at an exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi, Friday. Another multiple Olympic gold medalist, Mo Farah, also received a knighthood after defending his   and 10, 000m track titles in Rio.  The distance runner, who came to the UK from Somalia at the age of eight, was forced to deny doping allegations in 2015 after it emerged he missed two drugs tests in the buildup to London 2012. Jessica Ennis, who added heptathlon silver to London gold in Rio before retiring, was made a dame (the highest accolade for women) along with Olympic rowing gold medalist Katherine Grainger.

An arrest warrant was issued for Chung      daughter of Choi      in December for alleged interference of business. Choi was a friend and informal adviser to South Korean President Park   and has been described as a   character to the leader. Chung was taken into custody Sunday night in the northern Danish city of Aalborg by North Jutland Police and appeared in court Monday. She was remanded in custody for four weeks. Danish authorities said they have asked the South Korean Ministry of Justice to send a formal extradition request. At a press conference on December 21, Lee   a spokesman for South Korea’s special counsel team, told media that Chung    a   equestrian    was suspected to be in Germany. ”South Korean prosecutors plan to seek cooperation with German prosecutors on her arrest and freezing assets belonged to both Choi and Chung in Germany,” he said at the time.  RELATED: South Korea scandal    What you need to know, Special treatment, Chung, 20, is a   figure in South Korea. She won gold as a member of the group dressage equestrian event at the 2014 Asian Games. She’s also attracted public attention due to her family’s high profile, and suggestions that she’s used their connections to her advantage. Last year Chung was accused of receiving special treatment to secure admission to Ewha Woman’s University, a top school in Seoul. After the scandal emerged, the university canceled Chung’s admission and expelled her.  The head of the university also resigned. Chung is also reported to have received 2. 8 million euros from Samsung.  During a parliamentary hearing in early December, Samsung’s J. Y Lee admitted the company had provided Choi’s daughter with a horse and apologized. He said he didn’t recall how much Samsung had provided to Choi and Chung in total. Choi, a close confidant of President Park   is on trial on charges of abuse of power and attempted fraud following accusations she had access to secret government documents and intervened in state affairs. After weeks of protest, South Korea’s parliament voted on December 9 to impeach Park."
31627,31642,50408,’Stray’ bullet hits Texas legislator in the head,CNN,Azadeh Ansari,1/2/17,2017,1,," (CNN) A Texas lawmaker is lucky to be alive after an apparently stray bullet hit his head during a New Year’s celebration early Sunday, authorities said. State Rep. Armando ”Mando” Martinez,   said his wife had just given him a kiss shortly after ringing in the new year with family and friends, and the next thing he knew, ”it felt like a sledgehammer hit me over the head.” A bullet fragment had just punctured the top of the south Texas legislator’s head. Martinez said he had just stepped outside a home in a rural neighborhood north of Weslaco when he was hit. Martinez, 40, was transferred to the neurosurgical unit at Valley Baptist Medical Center in Harlingen, where surgeons removed the bullet fragment. The fragment had penetrated his skull and lodged itself into the dura mater, the top layer of the brain, doctors told Martinez.  The fragment appears to be from a . 223 caliber round, said Martinez, who spoke to CNN by phone on Sunday while recovering at the hospital.   ”Had it gone any further, I don’t think we would be having this conversation,” Martinez said.  Hidalgo County Sheriff Eddie Guerra said Martinez’s survival was nothing short of a miracle. The sheriff’s office is investigating the shooting, and investigators ”have reason to believe that (Martinez) was hit by a stray bullet,” county sheriff’s office spokesman JP Rodriguez said. ”There is no evidence to indicate he was targeted,” Rodriguez said. ”It was a miracle last night. I was given another chance at life and I’m grateful for it,” Martinez said.  Martinez was elected to a seventh term in November and scheduled to take the oath of office January 10."
31628,31643,50409,"The bleak, depressing reality for young Arabs",CNN,Nic Robertson,12/30/16,2016,12,," (CNN) Who remembers Mohamed Bouazizi? The answer, maybe, is not many of us. Perhaps we can be forgiven. So much has happened in the past six years, so much has changed. But if you happen to be a young Arab as Bouazizi was, living in the Middle East, not all of that change has been for good. Mohamed Bouazizi was the Tunisian street vendor who set himself on fire after an argument with a policeman late in 2010. He was crushed in the outfall of the 2008 economic crash. His death spread flames across the Middle East in what was to become known as the Arab Spring. Related: The man who set off revolutions, A bold and troubling UN report on Human Development in the Arab world warns the kindling that fueled the Arab Spring is drier than ever. To be a young Arab in the Middle East today is to be more disadvantaged and more vulnerable to violence than any other time in recent history. Between 2000 and 2003, there were four conflicts in the Middle East, according to the report. That number has grown to 11 between 2010 and 2015, and by the end of the decade, the report concludes, three out of four countries in the region could be ”vulnerable to conflict.”  Arabs are exposed to violence and upheaval in a way that no other large   group is. Though the Arab region contains just 5% of the world’s population, it has 17% of the global conflicts, 45% of all terrorist attacks and 57. 5% of the worldwide total of displaced people. The statistics on violence become even more worrying when the economic woes and an   population are put in the picture. At least 30% of Arabs are aged 15 to 29 years old    that’s 105 million people. Sixty percent of the population is under 30. While the Human Development Index (HDI) in the three decades prior to Bouazizi’s   showed improvements in education and health care, the economy fell behind, triggering an overall downturn. Experts use the HDI to measure ”human ” a function of long healthy lives, being well educated and having a decent standard of living. For young Arabs in the Middle East, HDI growth in the five years after 2010 is half what it was in the previous decade and markedly below the world average. The backdrop to these numbers is gloomy. The instability and political uncertainty make it difficult to look to country leaders for direction and job creation to employ their growing populations. Unemployment in 2014 was two times the global average    almost 30% of Arab young people versus a 13. 99% average in the rest of the world. And as poor economic prospects often provide a pathway toward radicalism, that alone is deeply troubling.  And consider this    In the past few months, a boatload of migrants believed to be from Libya sank in the Mediterranean with the loss of dozens of lives. It was later found many were Egyptian youths hoping to find a better life in Europe, perhaps hoping to send money home to struggling relatives. Egypt is a case in point. A population of close to 100 million, a tanking economy, rising prices and a leadership struggling to lift the country out of the downward spiral, the youth showed they had the resilience to take on the regime in protests from  . The UN report estimates young Arabs are twice as likely as   countries’ youths to take to the streets in protest. It says that 68% of Arab youths versus 87% of young people in other   countries are likely to vote    a differential that speaks volumes about their confidence in democracy and their ability to shape it. The assessment by the UN in its   report is that across the Middle East, approximately 60 million new jobs will be needed by 2020 to even begin to meet needs, never mind expectations. The implications are clear. Unless the leaders of some of the most populous countries in the Middle East rise to the challenge and create jobs    and therefore hope    for their booming young populations, there will be more strife ahead and that trouble    unlike the early days of the Arab Spring    may not stay at home."
31629,31644,50410,Chicago’s 762 homicides in 2016 is highest in 19 years,CNN,Azadeh Ansari,1/2/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Chicago marked 2016 as the deadliest year in nearly two decades, data released by the Chicago Police Department shows.  The city saw a surge in gun violence in 2016: 762 murders, 3, 550 shooting incidents, and 4, 331 shooting victims, according to a statement released by the department on Sunday.   There were 480 murders in 2015, the most in the city since 1997. The bloodshed has brought trauma to the lives of thousands of people. City police investigated 27 shooting incidents, 12 of which were fatal, just in the last week of December 2016.  Attacks on police officers nearly doubled in 2016, which represents a ”completely unacceptable rise in violence,” the release said. However, it did not state specific figures for attacks on officers.  As part of plan to combat the rising homicide count, the Chicago Police Department will amp up its force in 2017.  In August, Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner passed a gun control law that imposes stiffer penalties on anyone without a   identification card who brings a gun into the state intending to sell it. Not all figures were negative. City officers made 10% more gun arrests in 2016 and confiscated 8, 300 guns, a 20% increase from 2015, the release said.  "
31630,31645,50411,The new face of Mother Emanuel,CNN,Darran Simon,1/2/17,2017,1,,"Charleston, South Carolina (CNN) The young pastor stood in a house filled with mourners ready to minister. His parishioner had been strangled, her body dumped. The Rev. Eric S. C. Manning prayed with the victim’s devastated mother, reciting from Psalms, one of his favorite books in the Bible: ”I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.” Days later, Manning led the funeral for the young woman.  It was his first eulogy for a murder victim. ”Standing there delivering the eulogy was hard but God brought me through that,” he said, recalling that emotional moment 14 years ago. Over the years, Manning has dealt with tragedy and death, including in his own family.  And the prayers and comfort he knows how to give to people who have lost a loved one in a sudden, savage way prepared him for what is one of the toughest recent pastor assignments in America: being the spiritual leader of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, where white supremacist Dylann Roof killed nine members, including the church’s beloved pastor, during a Bible study in June 2015. ”God, through every aspect, every juncture of my life, was preparing me for this time,” said Manning, 49, who was handpicked to shepherd a traumatized congregation that he admits he’s still figuring out how to lead. ”No one’s ever seen this before.” Gifts and graces for the situation, Manning is a dignified man who often wears one of the 30 to 40 bow ties he owns. He wore his clergy robe when he sat in a Charleston courtroom last month providing what he called ”a ministry of presence.” Armed with his Bible, he listened as family members of victims and survivors gave graphic, emotional testimony during Roof’s federal trial. Sometimes, Manning placed his hand on a shoulder or gave a hug. ”He has all of the gifts and graces that a situation like that could call for,” said the Rev. Wendell Christopher Sr. who knows Manning and once led the Maryland church where the parishioner was strangled in 2002. ”They couldn’t have appointed a better man, a better pastor than Rev. Manning.” A jury swiftly convicted Roof on all counts. On Tuesday, the jury will decide his sentence. Some family members of victims appear torn over whether Roof should be sentenced to death. Manning, who is against the death penalty, said the trial drained him. But he plans to be back in court, Bible in tow, on Tuesday for phase two. Summoned to a traumatized church, Roof targeted the historically black church, often called Mother Emanuel, on June 17, 2015, because he wanted to start a race war, he told the FBI. He showed up at the Bible study, where the group welcomed him and handed him a sheet of verses. He sat with the victims for about 15 minutes and then, when they stood for prayers, pulled out a Glock .  pistol and fired 70 rounds at them. Last June, a few days after the anniversary of the massacre, Manning was working in his office at Bethel AME in Georgetown, South Carolina, when his phone rang. It was Bishop Richard Franklin Norris, leader of the 7th Episcopal District that includes the scores of AME churches in South Carolina. ”I need you to go to Mother Emanuel,” Manning recalled Norris saying. Manning took a step back and sat in a chair. Humbled by the request, he called his wife. ”I told him to follow his heart,” Andretta Manning, 47, said. In June 2016, Manning became Emanuel’s new leader, replacing a pastor who had been reassigned after six months at the church following the Roof shootings. ’God will continue to guide me’ Word soon spread across South Carolina that Manning was Emanuel’s new pastor. Mark Ross, a professor of theology at Erskine Theological Seminary’s Columbia, South Carolina, campus where Manning had earned his master of divinity degree in 2011, sent his former prized pupil an email offering prayers. ”He’s one of those students in your class that you’re expecting great things will come of him,” Ross recalled.    In the email exchange that Ross shared with CNN, Manning thanked his former professor for ”being such a great inspiration” and wrote that, in retrospect, he could see ”that the Lord was preparing me for such an awesome task (I never thought that it would be something such as this).” ”God will continue to guide me,” he wrote. Manning had led four AME churches in South Carolina over a dozen years before his appointment to Emanuel. At each church, he learned the names of his parishioners so he could address them personally when he prayed for them.  ”My husband is the type of person that, wherever he’s assigned, that’s where his heart is, with the people,” his wife said. At Emanuel, Manning said he reached out to the families of the victims and the survivors to get to know them. ”We talked, we cried. . .. We laughed,” he said. Clifford Jones, a lifelong Emanuel member whose cousin, Ethel Lance, 70, died in the shooting, said he has been impressed with Manning’s devotion to the families and survivors who have suffered. ”We had those trials the last couple of weeks and he was there every day for the families,” said Jones, 56, a disabled Army veteran living in North Charleston, South Carolina. ”That just shows he’s dedicated and he’s passionate, and he cares.”  Finding his call, Manning’s path to ministry started to form early, though he didn’t realize it at the time. Manning recalled that a career placement questionnaire he filled out while in high school in the Philadelphia suburbs listed his possible career paths as the military, law and religion. The military came first. Manning spent six years in active duty in the Army in his late teens and early 20s, rising to the rank of sergeant. He laid eyes on his future wife when they were both stationed in South Korea. Andretta Manning came from a military family of eight siblings. The couple married six months later, on January 25, 1991. The Mannings later moved to Florence, South Carolina, where Manning’s mother had relocated. She soon left her church but Manning stayed, and he set out on his path to the ministry. His initial sermon in 1995 touched on walking in the spirit and not the flesh. He was ordained two years later.  ”Looking back at it, I responded in the due season that God would have me respond,” Manning said. Prepared for ’difficult times’ By the late 1990s, the Mannings were parents of two young children. He moved the family to Maryland for a job in information technology, a career that was helping pay the bills while he also served as a pastor. The family later joined Mt. Moriah AME Church in Annapolis, where he became the associate pastor. Manning would deal with several difficult deaths in his family. In one instance, his    had beaten cancer in his lungs, but the disease then attacked his brain. Manning drove his wife back and forth on trips from Maryland to Rhode Island to care for her father. He ministered to her and her siblings, and eulogized his    at his funeral. Manning’s wife said the experience ”prepared him for the difficult times . .. having to be there for people that are close to you.” His readiness to deal with a violent death was tested in September 2002 when his parishioner was violently killed. ”It was a murder it was something I’d never dealt with. I never thought we would have to deal with,” he said of the death of Paula Lynne Edwards, the parishioner. ”But we did.”  Forgiveness brings peace, Edwards, 34, was a mother of three girls and a school bus driver. Police found her body on September 7, 2002, said her mother, Betty J. Edwards, 79, a retired teacher. She recalled that Manning visited the family the next day after church service. He told her, ”God will give you the strength that you need.” Edwards, of Severna Park, Maryland, said Manning: ”just consoled me in what he said.” Paula Edwards’ oldest daughter, Monica Alexander, also remembers Manning’s consoling advice. ”You’re not going to forget but when you are ready in your life, you’ll have to find some type of forgiveness so that you can have peace,” Alexander, 29, of Glen Burnie, Maryland, recalled him saying. Her father was sentenced to 30 years in prison for killing her mother.   ’I am here to serve you’ In the days leading up to his arrival at Emanuel, Manning prayed and fasted. He declined interviews, he said, because he wanted the congregation to learn about its new pastor in person, not through media reports. He hoped to show parishioners he believed he was ”a pastor after God’s own heart,” he said. He settled on scriptures from Psalms for his first sermon, including the familiar ”The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want.” He told his congregation ”he didn’t know how to lead them,” he recalled, but he would lean on God’s guidance. After the sermon, he said one member told him, ”We’re going to take care of you while you’re here.” He responded: ”No, I am here to serve you.” Bearing a heavy load, Emanuel now draws a steady stream of visitors who know what happened there. Some come to worship, some come out of macabre curiosity.  ”If they come to be a spectator, who knows, they might leave a worshiper,” Manning said.  ”If they come . .. out of curiosity, they may leave having a deeper understanding of God’s love and grace.” Manning believes that grace was visible as he and the families of the victims endured the trial last month. In one of the most chilling moments of the roughly weeklong proceeding, they watched a police video of Roof laughing after confessing to the shootings. Like everyone, Manning felt the heavy weight of the trial. One night he asked his wife, ”How much more do you think I can handle?” He knows the congregation’s healing continues    and that they will heal together. In his sermons, he often refers to the congregation as one: ”We are Mother Emanuel.” ”We are a body of believers who have gone through a tragedy the world has watched us,” he said. ”We will continue to have resilience. . .. We will continue to believe that God is still in the midst.”"

31632,31647,50413,The agony of Earth’s hottest year ,CNN,John D. Sutter,12/29/16,2016,12,,"Shishmaref, Alaska (CNN) Sick of the cold? Tired of ice? This little Inupiat village    about 30 miles from the Arctic Circle    would gladly take a dose of both.  ”I miss that   weather,” said Hazel Fernandez, 62. ”It’s too weird. It’s too warm.” Outside, Shishmaref, Alaska, looked like this:  My phone showed the temperature at 24 degrees Fahrenheit ( . 4º Celsius).  But that felt downright steamy to Fernandez and others.  She was wearing sneakers instead of insulated boots or sealskin mittens.  Old timers prefer weather that’s 20 or 30 below.  Globally, 2016 is expected to be the hottest on record    breaking the record set in 2015, which broke the record from the year before that. (Breitbart News and others are cherry picking data to tell you otherwise.) In all, scientists say humans have warmed the planet about 1 degree Celsius since around the time of the Industrial Revolution. This heat, which we’re causing by burning fossil fuels and trapping warmth in the atmosphere, is contributing to a host of dangerous weather around the world. A flood this August in Louisiana, for example, killed 13 people. Scientists say that event was made 40% more likely    and 10% more intense    because of climate change. Perhaps nowhere are the consequences more apparent than here in the Arctic, which is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet. In   temperatures across the far north were up to 35 degrees Fahrenheit above normal, shocking scientists.  On December 22, the North Pole was a stunning 50 degrees above average. The heat comes with dire consequences.  In August, this   village voted to relocate because this barrier island is melting. The permafrost is thawing out from beneath homes, and huge chunks of the coast are crumbling. To understand the toll this takes, visit the tiny blue house at the edge of the land.  There, I found Shelton Kokeok, 72, sitting at a kitchen table and staring out the window at the Chukchi Sea. The water looked like   slush on December 19.  ”It’s not frozen, it’s not frozen,” he said, sounding distraught. ”You better not take a walk out there. That ice should be solid    thick and solid now. It used to be really cold.”  The slush is a personal affront to Kokeok. Freakishly warm temperatures have melted the ocean and the coastline, causing one of his neighbor’s homes to topple off the edge. Most of his other neighbors moved their homes across the island and farther from danger. The sea ice helps protect the island from storms, so Kokeok doesn’t feel safe until it’s solid.  It’s been freezing far later and thawing far earlier.  Arctic sea ice tied 2007 for its   extent this year.  On the coffee table in his living room, Kokeok keeps a photo of his son, Norman. On June 2, 2007, he fell through thin ice on a hunting trip and died.  Kokeok blames warming for taking his son’s life.  Elders in the village told me the ice where he was hunting should have been solid then.  Kokeok would rather stay at his perch at the edge of the Earth, but residents voted    89 to 78    to get out. It’s unclear when that will happen or how much it will cost, said Annie Weyiouanna, who is coordinating the move for the local tribe.  In December, no one was packing.  There’s been no funding dedicated to relocation, Weyiouanna said.  It’s difficult to overstate the significance of that vote. Shishmaref has been here for 400 years, and before that the community was nomadic, seeking out the best spots along this coast to hunt seal, walrus and caribou and to gather orange and red tundra berries. Locals still live off the land. You’ll find seal oil    made from blubber    in most homes. There’s no running water or sewage, so locals harvest giant chunks of ice and melt it for drinking water.  It’s a hard life, but one rich in culture and meaning.  We’re putting that in jeopardy by using fossil fuels.  We’re also putting ourselves at risk. No matter where we live, the consequences of a   climate are here    and will get far, far worse if we don’t switch to cleaner forms of energy. Shishmaref may seem far and away, but   worse floods, failed crops, mass extinction and climate refugees will be all of our problem.  Visiting the Arctic is simply a window into the future of climate change if we fail to act. I met Fernandez, the woman who misses the ” ” weather, in a community hall in Shishmaref on a recent morning in December. Her friend Susie Nayokpuk was wearing a pink   and selling   lottery tickets. She’d rather be ice fishing, she said, but the sea wasn’t frozen. ”It’s the world changing, I guess,” she said.  Yes, and we are the ones changing it. "
31633,31648,50414,Chicago’s homicides: How we got here,CNN,,9/6/16,2016,9,,"Chicago’s 500th homicide of the year happened over Labor Day weekend, according to the Chicago Tribune. That number carries a lot of weight for the city    not just in quantity, but in meaning: 2016 is now the deadliest year in two decades. CHICAGO VS. OTHER CITIES, When you compare Chicago’s homicide rate to that of other big cities in the country    New York and Los Angeles, for example     it tops the list. But Chicago is not the homicide capital of the United States. New Orleans, St. Louis, Detroit, Baltimore and Newark all have higher rates when you drill down the data per capita. However, this doesn’t tell the entire story of Chicago’s bloodshed. There’s another statistic that points to a disturbing trend the city is facing: a surge. WHAT 500 MEANS, In the early 2000s, the homicide rate in Chicago held steady, but it began an upward tick in 2014 and has been increasing ever since.  But 2016 is the deadliest year in two decades when it comes to homicide rates.  Chicago hit 500 homicides before the end of the summer. In 2015, the city had 480 homicides total. The    breakdown of those figures is alarming. For example, there were 12 murders on Father’s Day weekend alone. The youngest victim was just 16. THE GUN PROBLEM, A lot of the homicides in Chicago are  . There are nearly 82 shootings per week. In just one weekend in August, there were eight   homicides and 64   shootings.  Chicago has strict gun laws, which is why many gun rights advocates point to it as evidence that tighter regulation doesn’t equal less crime. But Chicago’s gun violence problem is more complicated. Sixty percent of the guns used in shootings were purchased out of state.  ”We border Indiana and Wisconsin, which have really lax gun laws,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said.  ”We know that people from Chicago go across the border, fill up gym bags with illegal weapons from gun shows and things of that nature and they come back here and sell them to the gangs.” Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner recently signed a new gun control law that imposes harsher penalties on those who bring in guns from out of state to sell and do not have   ID cards. WHO’S TO BLAME? There’s a deeply rooted distrust of Chicago’s police force.  The city’s police department has been under review for months in the wake of     shootings, including that of Laquan McDonald.  An independent task force has accused the police department of institutional racism, saying officers ”have no regard for the sanctity of life when it comes to people of color.” However,   shootings are only a tiny portion of Chicago’s homicide rate. From January 1 to September 8, there were six deaths tied to   shootings, according to the Independent Police Review Authority. Furthermore, there have been 13 instances this year in which a Chicago cop fired a weapon and hit an individual.   The other side of this battle is the street crime in Chicago, which has led to the killing of innocent bystanders and kept residents shut inside their homes out of fear. Englewood resident Stephanie Armas, 43, said she taught her kids from a very young age what to do when they hear gunshots.   ”If you live in a society where (your children) have to learn to duck and dodge bullets, you have to teach them how to duck and dodge bullets,” Armas said on September 1. ”That’s all you can do.” Some Chicagoans partly blame the violence on economic struggles and lack of jobs. However, Chicago’s unemployment rate fell from 6. 1% in 2015 to 5. 5% in 2016. Johnson said police can only do so much. Social problems are the root cause of the violence, he said. ”We can’t arrest our way out of this situation,” he said. ”That’s just not going to happen.” THE PEOPLE, We often point to Chicago’s alarming homicide numbers, but the real tragedy in this city are the victims and the families left behind.  They are the ones who face this violence every day, the ones who stand over gravestones, the ones who’ve lost hundreds of sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, mothers and fathers. Here are a few Chicagoans we’ve met during our reporting: Tre Bosley lost his brother, Terrell, when he was mistakenly shot by a gang member while helping a friend take drums into a church.

31634,31649,50415,Computer outage disrupts customs at US airports,CNN,Tony Marco,1/3/17,2017,1,," (CNN) A computer outage at US airports Monday evening left thousands of inbound international travelers stuck behind customs screening stations for hours on one of the busiest travel days of the year. The US Customs and Border Protection processing systems were back online at all airports later in the night, spokesman Daniel Hetlage said    but not before creating long lines of disgruntled holiday travelers. The outage lasted from about 5 to 9 p. m. ET, Hetlage said. Airport officials and travelers across the country reported delays ranging from 30 minutes to two hours. CBP officers processed international travelers through ”alternative procedures” while the agency scrambled to get systems back online. ”During the technology disruption, CBP had access to national   databases and all travelers were screened according to security standards,” Hetlage said. ”At this time, there is no indication the service disruption was malicious in nature.”  The outage affected passengers on more than 30 flights into Miami International Airport beginning at 6 p. m. spokeswoman Suzy Trutie said. Even after service resumed, the airport said it would take extra time for CBP officers to process. The outage lasted about 90 minutes at   Atlanta International Airport before computers were running again, US Customs and Border Protection spokesman Rob Brisley said. Jennifer   was returning from a family vacation in London when she arrived at Salt Lake City International Airport. ”Delta had us all line up after we landed and it took a while before customs was even able to find us a place where we could wait because the airport is so small,”   said. ”I would not have had any idea of what was going on if my cousin did not text me.” College student Chinedu Elendu was returning with his brother and sister from a family vacation in Nigeria when the outage held him up for about an hour and a half at San Francisco International Airport.  They had just finished two legs of their journey: a 6.  flight from Nigeria to Frankfurt, Germany, followed by an 11.  flight to San Francisco, he said. ”When we got to the place in customs where you scan your passport, my brother and sister scanned theirs and got through fine. Mine did not scan and I had to get in a different line. That was the line that took so long,” Elendu said. No announcements were made at the airport explaining the delay, he said. He overheard people talking about a nationwide computer problem affecting people with all kinds of passports.   Elendu still had one more leg of his trip as he headed back to Portland, Oregon, for school."

DAMAC Properties, Sajwani’s company, has built the Trump International Course Dubai. They are currently working on a second course, designed by Tiger Woods, which is set to open in 2018. ”Hussain and the whole family, the most beautiful people, are here from Dubai tonight. And they’re seeing it and they’re loving it,” Trump said, referring to the ornate Grand Ballroom that he built at   . Video of the speech was provided to CNN by a person who attended the party.

Even if Trump creates a wall between himself and his children running his company, he still will know the identity of his   business partners. ”  Trump is using his largesse as   to enhance his existing business relationships,” political law attorney Ken Gross told CNN. ”Apparently, in his view, this practice does not run afoul of the representations he has made to date regarding the disentanglement of his business and official functions. It remains to be seen if this will ever get sorted out.” Trump’s transition team said the   and Sajwani didn’t discuss their business partnership in Florida. ”They had no formal meetings or professional discussions. Their interactions were social,” said Hope Hicks, Trump’s spokeswoman.  And Kellyanne Conway, a top Trump adviser, defended the  . ”This man is allowed to have a New Year’s Eve celebration with his friends, or his business partners, or his acquaintances,” she told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on ”Anderson Cooper 360.” ”I spent a lot of time at    during this break, including I had dinner with the Hussains one night . .. Hussain and his wife, absolutely lovely people.” She added: ”If you took that example to it’s extreme, nobody would be able to be friends with anybody else.” ”Nothing has changed,” Niall McLoughlin, Vice President of Corporate Communication and Marketing at DAMAC told CNN when asked where the terms of business have changes since the election.  ”They like each other’s company and they were together over the new year as social friends,” he said.  When asked if Trump or the Trump Organization have outlined a new structure to avoid a conflict of interest, McLoughlin said ”We have been dealing with Donald Trump’s children and family over the last three years   Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr.” ”I would be speculating if I commented on any changes in the future,” he added. ”Our relationship is with the Trump Organization,” he said ”but Mr Sajwani has a relationship that ”goes back over a decade” with Mr Trump. Sajwani’s son Abbas posted a photo over the weekend from   . ”Scenic,” was how he captioned a picture from the private club’s pool. Photos provided to CNN also show Sajwani and his family attending   ’s Christmas Eve dinner and interacting with Trump. Trump and Sanjwani’s relationship began in 2005. They originally had plans to build a tower in Dubai, but canceled the idea after the global financial crisis. Trump scrapped a December news conference in which he was set to announce his plans to address his conflicts of interests. Trump has said he will make an announcement sometime before the inauguration. Speaking this weekend at    the first billionaire   seemed unfazed by the conflicts. ”It is not a big deal. You people are making that a big deal, the business,” Trump said. ”It’s actually a very simple situation.”  In his   speech Saturday, Trump described in detail his electoral victory, providing a    recap of places most expected him to loose. He claimed his wife Melania’s late campaign speech in Pennsylvania helped turn the state in his favor. He told the   crowd he was planning an aggressive beginning to his administration, vowing to loosen regulations and end President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. ”Regulations are coming off, we’re going to get rid of Obamacare,” he said, also vowing again to construct a border wall between the United States and Mexico. Trump also provided more detail about his bid to reduce the costs of the new Air Force One. He said that when he met with US military brass following the election, they informed him that a new aircraft would cost in the $4 billion range  —   a price he deemed unacceptable. Trump had made the claim previously, though hadn’t identified where the price figures came from. US officials, including at the White House, have suggested the $4 billion is inflated. During his speech, Trump claimed to have cut $1 billion from the price tag for the new presidential aircraft.

He was less enthusiastic about their guests. ”I don’t really care too much about the guests. I don’t give a s*** about their guests,” Trump said. And he repeated his harsh criticism of the media, claiming they were in the back of the room. (The press assigned to cover Trump’s movements was not present in the ballroom during Trump’s speech). ”They’re really garbage,” Trump said of the press."
31636,31651,50417,Russia sanctions announced by White House,CNN,Evan Perez,12/29/16,2016,12,," (CNN) President Barack Obama took unprecedented steps Thursday to retaliate against alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election, prompting vows from Russian authorities that Moscow will respond in kind. The administration described Russia’s involvement as ”Significant Malicious   Activities” and sanctioned four Russian individuals and five Russian entities for what it said was election interference. The administration also ordered 35 Russian diplomats to leave the country and two Russian compounds are being closed. This is the first time the names of Russian officials involved in the hacking have become public on the sanctions list. ”Russia’s cyberactivities were intended to influence the election, erode faith in US democratic institutions, sow doubt about the integrity of our electoral process, and undermine confidence in the institutions of the US government,” a White House statement said. ”These actions are unacceptable and will not be tolerated.” RELATED: Obama puts Trump on the spot with Russia sanctions, According to statements from the White House and the Treasury Department, the government has sanctioned nine entities and individuals over their alleged interference in the election: the GRU and the FSB, which are two Russian intelligence services four individual officers of the GRU and three companies that provided material support to the GRU’s operations.  The US also separately sanctioned two Russian individuals, Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev and Alexey Belan, for using   means to allegedly cause misappropriation of funds and personal identifying information. They’ve long been sought by the FBI. Obama also said in the statement announcing that the diplomats have been ordered to leave the country and that those individuals and their families were given 72 hours to leave the United States. ”These actions follow repeated private and public warnings that we have issued to the Russian government, and are a necessary and appropriate response to efforts to harm US interests in violation of established international norms of behavior,” Obama said in the statement.   Donald Trump    who has publicly expressed skepticism that Russia meddled in the election    said Thursday it’s time for the US to ”move on” regarding the hacking. But he added that he would meet with intelligence officials next week to be briefed on the matter. ”It’s time for our country to move on to bigger and better things,” Trump said in a statement. ”Nevertheless, in the interest of our country and its great people, I will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation.” A senior Obama administration official acknowledged to reporters Thursday that Trump could reverse the sanctions by executive order, but added, ”I don’t think it’d make a lot of sense.” The Russian diplomats and the two compounds, located in Maryland and New York, were engaged in intelligence activities but were not alleged to have been involved in the hacking related to the election, White House Homeland Security adviser Lisa Monaco told reporters. The moves are instead part of the US’s comprehensive reaction to   hacking as well as recent harassment of US personnel in Russia. ”What these individuals were doing were basically collecting intelligence. They were intelligence officers operating here and using these compounds, one in New York, one in Maryland, for intelligence collection purposes,” Monaco told CNN’s Jake Tapper on ”The Lead” Thursday. ”And what we are saying today is, in response to and in order to impose consequences for the Russian government’s increasing harassment and aggression toward our personnel in Moscow, and, of course, their malicious cyberactivities, interfering and an effort to interfere in our election process, we are imposing consequences.” Russia’s reaction, Russia swiftly responded to the actions Thursday. Russia will respond to any ”hostile steps” that the US may take in response to allegations of hacking during the 2016 election, according to the official representative for the ministry.  Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said similar steps will be taken in response to the expulsions, though she did not immediately provide further details. Dmitri Peskov, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, told reporters there is ”no alternative to reciprocal measures,” adding that Putin is ”in no rush to make a decision.” Russia’s first visible action came later Thursday, when Russian authorities ordered the closure of the   School of Moscow, a US official briefed on the matter said. The order from the Russian government closes the school, which serves children of US, British and Canadian embassy personnel, to US and foreign nationals. The order also closes access to the US embassy vacation house in Serebryany Bor, near Moscow. Soon after the administration’s announcement, Russia’s embassy in the UK tweeted that Obama’s actions were ”Cold War deja vu” and described the administration as ”hapless.” Congressional Republicans split with Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, called the sanctions ”overdue,” adding that it is an ”appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia.” ”Russia does not share America’s interests,” he said in a statement Thursday. ”In fact, it has consistently sought to undermine them, sowing dangerous instability around the world. While today’s action by the administration is overdue, it is an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia. And it serves as a prime example of this administration’s ineffective foreign policy that has left America weaker in the eyes of the world.” Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham, two of Russia’s fiercest critics in the US Senate, called for stronger sanctions against Russia. ”The retaliatory measures announced by the Obama administration today are long overdue. But ultimately, they are a small price for Russia to pay for its brazen attack on American democracy. We intend to lead the effort in the new Congress to impose stronger sanctions on Russia,” the two said in a joint statement. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper issued a statement on Thursday reiterating the agency’s confidence that the Russian government was involved in the US hacking. ”This activity by Russian intelligence services is part of a   campaign of   operations directed at the US Government and its citizens,” the statement read. ”The US Government can confirm that the Russian government, including Russia’s civilian and military intelligence services, conducted many of the activities generally described by a number of these security companies.” Months of internal debate, The administration’s announcement comes after months of internal debate over how to respond to Russian hacking that US law enforcement and intelligence agencies have watched take place for over a year. The US government announced in October that it was ”confident” that the Russian government orchestrated the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations of the Democratic Party to influence the 2016 election. Those hacks resulted in the public release of thousands of stolen emails, many of which included damaging revelations about the Democratic Party and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the party’s nominee. The hacking of DNC emails eventually led to the resignation of former chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz after emails showed her favoring Clinton over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary. Earlier this month, the CIA announced to a group of senators that the hacks were aimed to help elect Trump as president."
31637,31652,50418,"Trump to ’repeal a lot’ of Obama’s actions on day one, top aide says",CNN,Eric Bradner,1/1/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN)  Donald Trump plans to repeal a raft of President Barack Obama’s executive actions in his first day in office, Trump’s incoming White House press secretary said Sunday.  Members of the transition team are meeting this week to discuss what actions the incoming president will undertake on day one, a source told CNN Monday.  Sean Spicer, Trump’s incoming White House press secretary, said on ABC’s ”This Week” that Trump will immediately ”repeal a lot of the regulations and actions that have been taken by this administration over the last eight years that have hampered both economic growth and job creation.”  It was one of two moves Spicer said Trump will make immediately after he takes the oath of office.  He didn’t specify which executive actions Trump will repeal.  However, Trump has long been critical of Obama’s moves on immigration, energy regulation and foreign policy, and could look for ways to undo those and other actions.  Spicer also said Trump will begin reforms intended to ”bring a new brand to Washington” with a restriction on members of his administration becoming lobbyists for a period of five years after they leave Trump’s government. ”It’s very ” Spicer said. ”What we’ve had in the past is people who have looked in the rearview mirror.  This time, we’re thinking forward.  If you want to serve in a Trump administration, you’re going to serve this country, not yourself.” Historically on Inauguration Day, presidents have signed executive orders as well as presidential orders presenting the nomination of Cabinet officials.  But some of those executive orders never amount to much. For example, on his Inauguration Day, President Barack Obama announced a number of executive orders, including one mandating the prompt closure of the US prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Eight years later, the prison remains open."
31638,31653,50419,Netanyahu questioned in corruption probe,CNN,Oren Liebermann,1/2/17,2017,1,,"Jerusalem  (CNN) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was interrogated Monday night on suspicion of corruption in a criminal investigation authorized by the nation’s attorney general. Netanyahu is suspected of having received benefits from businessmen, according to Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld and Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit. Netanyahu was questioned ”under caution on the suspicions of receiving benefits,” said Rosenfeld. The term ”under caution” refers to the questioning of someone suspected of having committed a crime, with the warning that anything they say or decline to talk about could be used against them in court proceedings. Police and Mandelblit declined to release any further details of the   questioning.   ’There is nothing’ Netanyahu has repeatedly denied the allegations against him, saying they are politically motivated. On New Year’s Day, the Prime Minister posted on his Facebook page, ”Unfortunately you’ll have to be disappointed this time as well, like you were disappointed in previous affairs. As usual, there will not be anything because there is nothing. Try replacing the Prime Minister at the ballot box    as is customary in a democracy.” Netanyahu was investigated by police amid allegations of fraud and breach of trust in the late 1990s during his first term. He was never indicted. Netanyahu is in his fourth term. He has often had a combative relationship with the media, which have speculated for days about when the criminal investigation would officially begin and what it would entail. At a holiday event in late December, Netanyahu quipped that ”It’s fun” to spar with Israeli journalists on social media. Yair Lapid, a Knesset member who is one of the main political threats to Netanyahu, urged caution and a quick investigation. ”If two Prime Ministers in a row fall for corruption, it will be very difficult to rehabilitate the public’s trust in government,” Lapid said on Facebook, referencing Ehud Olmert, who served before Netanyahu and is now in prison for corruption. ”At the same time, for the benefit of the State of Israel and the people of Israel, [the investigation] must be fast.” Investigation ongoing, Until now, the inquiry was an examination. It did not reach the level of a criminal investigation, and Netanyahu was not suspected of having committed a crime. That changed as a police car pulled into his residence on Monday night, marking the beginning of the criminal investigation. The inquiry into Netanyahu began in   the attorney general said. But the specific accusation that led to the criminal investigation surfaced three months ago. Police investigators searched for the evidence to support the suspicion, and last month, found the evidence to warrant an investigation. Mandelblit would not elaborate on what the suspected crime was, instead ruling out  any link to investigations that have since been dismissed. Those include two issues related to the 2009 elections and primaries, and two issues related to receiving flights and benefits overseas. Netanyahu does not have to step down if he is suspected of committing a crime. He is only required to step down if he is convicted and that conviction is upheld by Israel’s high court. However, if he is indicted, he could face enormous public and political pressure to step down. Other Israeli prime ministers have been investigated, including Ariel Sharon, Ehud Barak and Olmert. "
31639,31654,50420,House Republicans pull plan to gut independent ethics committee  after Trump tweets,CNN,Deirdre Walsh,1/3/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN)  Donald Trump dramatically   House Republicans into line Tuesday in his first Washington power play, after they voted to gut an ethics watchdog in a manner that undercut his vow to drain the establishment ”swamp.” Trump made clear his anger at the move on his Twitter account, and GOP lawmakers hurriedly changed plans to target the independent panel, backing down in a controversy that threatened to overshadow the dawn of a new conservative era in Washington. In an emergency meeting just before noon Tuesday, House Republican lawmakers voted to strip the move on the ethics agency from a package of rules that is due to be voted upon later in the House of Representatives. Their decision to adopt the measure Monday night had opened splits in the GOP and put House Speaker Paul Ryan and Trump on opposite sides of a key issue on the first day of the 115th Congress. The swift developments were a first sign of how Trump plans to govern and wield the power of his presidency    and his Twitter account    to bend Washington to his will and an early indication of the new power dynamic between Congress and the White House. Trump called out his fellow Republicans for proposing to curb the powers of the independent ethics panel as their first move of the year, although the   suggested the ethics panel was ”unfair.”  ”With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it . .. may be, their number one act and priority. Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance! #DTS,” Trump said over two consecutive tweets.  Monday night, House Republicans voted   during a   meeting in favor of Virginia Rep. Bob Goodlatte’s proposal, which would place the independent Office of Congressional Ethics under the control of those very lawmakers. The full House was set to vote on the plan Tuesday, part of a larger package of House rules changes. But a public outcry, as well as Trump’s tweets, led to the language being dropped. A senior House GOP aide familiar with the discussion tells CNN that Ryan and Trump spoke Tuesday afternoon. ”The pressure was building in the press and from constituents this morning regarding the way the reforms were put into place last night. Early this morning it became clear we would have a vote problem on the floor with this amendment. Leadership called a special   meeting where it was agreed to by unanimous consent to strip the amendment,” the aide said. ”It’s safe to say that Trump’s tweets probably added to that pressure but it was already being heavily covered in the press,” the aide added. In the meeting Tuesday, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told Republicans that the rules package didn’t have the votes, Rep. Charlie Dent,   said. After Trump’s tweets, Ryan defended the proposed changes in a statement, marking the first   break with the   just days into the new year. ”After eight years of operation, many members believe the Office of Congressional Ethics is in need of reform to protect due process and ensure it is operating according to its stated mission,” Ryan said in a statement. ”I want to make clear that this House will hold its members to the highest ethical standards and the Office will continue to operate independently to provide public accountability to Congress.” An aide close to Ryan familiar with the discussions tells CNN that ”Ryan spoke out against the amendment and opposed it throughout. Today’s statement is an explanation of what the reform means and the action the speaker is taking to protect the office’s independence.” The proposed change in rules carried the appearance of House members taking power away from the office that can investigate them for misconduct, at a time when Republicans are about to have control of two branches of government with a mandate for shaking up Washington.  Democratic dilemma: How hard to fight Trump, The proposal would have barred the panel from reviewing any violation of criminal law by members of Congress, requiring that it turn over complaints instead to the House Ethics Committee or refer the matter to an appropriate federal law enforcement agency. The House Ethics Committee would also have the power to stop an investigation at any point and bars the ethics office from making any public statements about any matters or hiring any communications staff.  And the ethics office would no longer be able to accept or investigate any anonymous reports of alleged wrongdoing by members of Congress. Currently the ethics panel operates as an independent,   entity that has the power to investigate misconduct against lawmakers, officers and staff of the United States House of Representatives. Originally created by Congress under Nancy Pelosi’s speakership in the wake of multiple lobbying scandals, it continued to act as an independent body under   Speaker John Boehner.  Pelosi slammed the plan. ”House Republicans showed their true colors last night, and reversing their plans to destroy the Office of Congressional Ethics will not obscure their clear contempt for ethics in the People’s House,” she said in a statement after the Republicans withdrew the proposal. ”Republicans should remember the strength of public outrage they faced in the space of 12 hours as they scheme to do lasting damage to the health and economic security of millions and millions of   families.”  In Monday’s meeting,    members disregarded opposition from Ryan and voted to approve the new structure for ethics reviews going forward, according to a senior House GOP leadership source familiar with the   discussion. Members of both parties complain that panel often takes up matters based on partisan accusations from outside groups with political motivations, and once they launch a probe members have to mount expensive defense campaigns. In contrast to Trump’s tweets, his close aide Kellyanne Conway appeared supportive of the move in Tuesday television interviews. ”If a constituent has a complaint, they can still lodge that complaint,” Conway told NBC’s ”Today” show, adding that she hadn’t spoken with Trump on this issue specifically. ”They just can’t do it anonymously. And many of these people    members and their staffers who have been under investigation    they have complained about their due process rights being violated and compromised. They need protections, as well.” Republicans defend the plan, Goodlatte defended his proposal in the wake of the outrage Monday evening, telling CNN that the move ”will make sure that work is properly done,” but ”will also make sure that people who are wrongly charged have an opportunity to protect themselves.” ”There should be no entity in the entire federal government that doesn’t have review by some committee of the Congress so that’s all it sets up is oversight,” he said. ”It still has its designated statutory responsibilities. It has some new rules that it has to follow but it still is empowered to take complaints from individuals as it was intended to do and investigate those complaints but every agency of the government whether it’s executive, legislative or judicial should have a committee that reviews it’s work.” GOP Rep. Hal Rogers, the Appropriations Committee chairman, told reporters he backed the proposal because ”it’s the right thing to do.”  Rogers said there were ”numerous examples” of members ”who were falsely accused by this group who had to spend a fortune to get their good name restored so I think there’s been an abuse.” Texas Congressman Bill Flores also backed the change, saying the panel is ”out of control‎ we don’t even get constitutional rights, constitutional protections. They don’t tell us who accuses us and they leak the data    they are out of control.” Could come back, Rep. Steve King,   vowed to personally continue pressing for the ethics reforms.  He said Trump’s remarks ”animated the press”    leading the GOP to back away from what he said were changes that would have protected lawmakers from ”public criticism that’s generated by anonymous accusers.”  ”I’m concerned that now we have Republicans criticizing Republicans,” King said. ”We need to stay away from that.”  Outside ethics group point to the ethics panel as the only real entity policing members and argue its independent status and bipartisan board are an appropriate way to oversee investigations. ”Gutting the independent ethics office is exactly the wrong way to start a new Congress,” said Chris Carson, spokesperson for League of Women Voters, in a statement. ”This opens the door for special interest corruption just as the new Congress considers taxes and major infrastructure spending.”  Norman Eisen and Richard Painter, of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit watchdog group, said the ethics office ”has played a critical role in seeing that the congressional ethics process is no longer viewed as merely a means to sweep problems under the rug.”  ”If the 115th Congress begins with rules amendments undermining (the ethics office) it is setting itself up to be dogged by scandals and ethics issues for years and is returning the House to dark days when ethics violations were rampant and far too often tolerated,” they said in a Monday night statement. Eisen served as the top ethics lawyer for President Barack Obama and Painter held the same job under President George W. Bush.

31640,31655,50421,"Facing growing North Korea nuke threat, Trump vows: ’It won’t happen!’",CNN,Nicole Gaouette,1/2/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN)  Donald Trump had a message Monday for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his latest missile threats. ”North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U. S. It won’t happen!” Trump tweeted.  Trump quickly followed that up with a charge that China was doing nothing to help the US cope with the rogue nation. ”China has been taking out massive amounts of money  wealth from the U. S. in totally   trade, but won’t help with North Korea. Nice!” Trump wrote. The   launched his verbal missiles after the autocratic    North Korean leader declared in a televised New Year’s Day speech that his military is on the brink of testing its first intercontinental ballistic missile: a rocket that can be equipped with nuclear weapons and is powerful enough to reach any part of the US. A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry responded Tuesday to Trump, saying, ”China’s efforts in resolving the North Korea nuclear issue have been obvious to all. Our contribution has been widely recognized by the international community. As the host of the   talks, our efforts and achievements have been clear to all.” Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program (EANP) said Trump’s tweets were ”foolish, but probably harmless.” ”I think North Korea will probably test the   (intercontinental ballistic missile) this year, no matter what Trump tweets,” he said in an email to CNN. While US officials and military experts doubt many of Kim’s boasts, Trump may very well have to deal with an ICBM test and confront the danger Pyongyang poses to international stability. The hermit nation poses a unique threat. While the nuclear nations of China and Russia are both pushing back against US power across the globe, they are more integrated into the international system and neither is as erratic or threatening. This all moves Pyongyang to Trump’s front burner as a simmering problem that might soon boil over. Kim declared Sunday that his goal was ”to cope against the vicious threats for nuclear war by the Imperialists,” a sinister nod to the US and its Asian allies. Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway was asked on ”Good Morning America” on Tuesday what the   intended to do to stop North Korea’s nukes.  ”He’s not stated that publicly, and he won’t before he’s inaugurated,” Conway said. ”But we do know that there are sanctions that are possible,” she added. ”They have not always worked. I think China would have to have a significant role here as well. But he’s putting North Korea on notice through this tweet and other statements that this won’t happen. He, as President of the United States, wants to stand between them and their missile capabilities, which experts say could be deployed to reach Seattle almost immediately.” RELATED: Is North Korea’s leader the world’s ’most dangerous man’? North Korea has been steadily working to improve its missile and weapons capability, conducting a fifth nuclear test in September. American analysts say there are still questions about Pyongyang’s claims of technological advances    particularly to key elements required to deliver a nuclear payload    but the picture is still worrisome. ”It’s a very real and growing threat,” said Bruce Klinger, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. ”Think Don Corleone, but with nuclear weapons.”  North Korea might be easy to ridicule as ”the funny little country, with the funny little guy, with the funny little hairstyle out of Jersey Shore,” that can’t even provide electricity to its people, Klingner said. But ”North Korea is a   threat to the US, its allies and international peace and security.” ”This is the worst regime in the world trying to acquire the worst weapons in the world and the means to reach the US with them,” Victor Cha, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said of North Korea. ”In terms of a direct threat to American security, this is it.”  Russian, Chinese threats differ  He said that threat is different than that from major powers Russia and China. ”With Russia and China, we’re mutually deterred” because of nuclear capabilities, he explained. ”With North Korea, you just don’t know what this guy is going to do.” Pyongyang has a   army poised along the border with South Korea, where US forces are based. The state engages in massive counterfeiting operations of the US $100 bill and in the manufacturing of methamphetamine. US security officials place it in the top five cyber threats worldwide. It has an estimated 16 to 20 nuclear weapons and is steadily working to miniaturize them and improve the range and accuracy of missiles to deliver them. North Korea’s new boast about an ICBM that could deliver those weapons to the US comes as Washington is undergoing a leadership transition    always a fragile time    and South Korea is in political disarray, with its president temporarily stripped of her powers because of corruption charges and facing a court ruling on whether she should be reinstated or removed from office. Kim sees 2017 as ”an opportune time” to complete development of a nuclear weapon because of these leadership challenges, according to a   North Korean diplomat who recently defected to South Korea. Kim is ”determined” to complete development of a nuclear weapon by the end of 2017, the diplomat said at a December press briefing, according to Yonhap news agency.  ”This is not just   to get attention,” Cha said. ”This is an actual military goal they’re seeking.” And they’re well on their way, despite repeated international attempts over decades to slow Pyongyang’s program through sanctions and diplomacy. North Korea conducted an unprecedented number of missile tests in 2016 and a satellite launch that experts call a sign that it has cleared significant hurdles toward ICBM technology.  It has already notched other potentially lethal successes.  Pyongyang fired a   ballistic missile in August, a weapon that South Korea has no viable defense against, said Klingner, a former chief of the CIA’s Korea branch. After the test, the South Korean Defense Ministry revised its estimate on the North’s ability to deploy   missiles from around four years to as little as a year.  The country likely already has working nuclear warheads for its Nodong   ballistic missile, which threatens all of South Korea and Japan, experts say. And Pyongyang’s intermediate range missile, the Musudan, can hit Guam, the location of a major US military base and a critical node in the defense of the western Pacific Ocean. It isn’t clear whether North Korea has the ability to put a nuclear warhead on the Musudan yet. The ICBM would be the next level up, putting the continental US within Pyongyang’s deadly reach. US   generals, including Gen. Vincent Brooks, who leads US forces in South Korea, and Adm. Harry Harris, head of US Pacific Command, say North Korea is nearing that capability. Other experts don’t think Pyongyang is quite there yet, but say it likely will be within Trump’s first term. Struggling to deliver nukes, Bruce Bennett, a a senior defense analyst at the Rand Corporation, says that despite North Korea’s apparent progress on a warhead, it doesn’t yet have good enough missile and rocket technology to deliver a nuke. A key question is whether they have the technology that would allow the missiles to   the atmosphere. North Koreans have this capability for the intermediate range Musudan missile, which can hit South Korea and Japan. It’s a harder technological feat to achieve   capability for an ICBM, which is subject to higher temperatures and greater velocities. For now, US military officials told CNN that they assess that North Korea still hasn’t mastered that technology or key elements of firing and fuzing a weapon.   ”They’re likely further along than many experts and pundits give them credit for,” according to Klingner. ”We may not know where they are on that path, but we know they’re on it.”  Kim boasted in his New Year’s remarks that his country has successfully tested a variety of ICBM technologies. ”Research and development of the   tech weapons are actively progressing and strengthening our defense capabilities, including   preparation of tests for intercontinental ballistic rocket launch have been continuously succeeding,” he declared. If the young leader goes ahead, an ICBM test would be a flagrant violation of numerous United Nations resolutions and beg a response from Trump. The   has called Kim a ”maniac,” but has also said he would sit down and negotiate with him, a break from   international norms.  A test would also deepen worries in South Korea and Japan, already rattled by suggestions from candidate Trump that the US should cover less of their defense and,  in another violation of international norms, that they should develop their own nuclear programs.  Increasing tension with China, And it would immediately increase tensions between the US and North Korea’s closest ally China, which Trump has suggested has ”total control” over Pyongyang. If China won’t rein North Korea in, Trump has suggested the US should ”make trade very difficult” with Beijing. He has also suggested that he would have China assassinate the North Korean leader to make him ”disappear in one form or another very quickly.”  Cha said the decision to stop North Korea from reaching the point where it could deter the US by threatening Honolulu or Los Angeles with destruction will be a personal one that the   will likely have to make. While some experts estimate Pyongyang will have an ICBM by 2020, Cha thinks it will be sooner. ”If the President decides this can’t stand, then all kinds of options open up for him” to take action, Cha said, including significant shifts in the US force posture in Asia and exerting greater pressure on China."
31641,31656,50422,Dylann Roof ruled competent for sentencing,CNN,,1/2/17,2017,1,," (CNN) A federal judge ruled Monday that Dylann Roof, convicted of killing nine people inside an   church in Charleston, South Carolina, is mentally competent to represent himself at the sentencing phase of his trial. That phase is scheduled to begin Wednesday morning at 9:30. Roof could be sentenced to death.  Roof was evaluated over the weekend by Dr. James Ballenger of Charleston, a specialist in forensic psychiatry, with the results presented in court. US District Judge Richard Gergel closed that part of the proceeding to the public, saying he wanted to protect Roof’s right to a fair trial and right to  . Ballenger evaluated Roof in November, before Roof was found competent after a   hearing, Gergel’s order said. But the court ”felt that the serious nature of the proceedings” against Roof indicated the need for another evaluation by the   Ballenger ”to confirm there were no material changes in his mental status” since then.  Ballenger and other witnesses testified during the daylong hearing Monday and Gergel ruled Roof ”remains competent to stand trial and  .” A more comprehensive opinion is expected to follow.  Roof’s sentencing phase had been scheduled for Tuesday but he requested an additional day because he had been required to spend most of the previous days on the court’s examination and competency hearing, according to the order.  Earlier, Gergel issued an order that said Roof ”will not attempt to approach the jury, the witness stand, or the bench,” during the sentencing.  A federal jury convicted Roof on December 15 of all charges stemming from the shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Roof attended a Bible study on June 17, 2015, before pulling out a pistol and killing nine people, investigators said. Roof carefully planned the killing, investigators said, and chose the church because he wanted to start a race war. Roof is white and all his victims were black. In a videotaped interview with detectives that was played for the jury, Roof said, ”I did it.” Roof’s second competency hearing was called at the request of defense lawyer David Bruck, who said he’d discovered new facts. After the first competency hearing in November, the judge sealed a document with the factual reasons behind his ruling, saying disclosure could hurt Roof’s chances of a fair trial. Some family members of victims appear torn over whether Roof should be sentenced to death. Only three federal inmates have been executed in the United States since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988 after a   moratorium.  Timothy McVeigh was convicted for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people. He was executed June 11, 2001. Juan Raul Garza was convicted of killing three people and running a marijuana drug ring in Texas. He was executed June 19, 2001. Louis Jones was convicted for the kidnapping and murder of    Army Pvt. Tracie McBride. He was executed March 18, 2003. The last person given a federal death sentence was bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in 2015 after he was convicted for his role in killing four people and wounding others in the 2013 Boston Marathon, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a Washington based nonprofit.  The US government and US military have 62 people awaiting execution, the center said.  Roof was convicted of 33 federal charges: nine counts of violating the Hate Crime Act resulting in death, three counts of violating the Hate Crime Act involving an attempt to kill, nine counts of obstruction of exercise of religion resulting in death, three counts of obstruction of exercise of religion involving an attempt to kill and use of a dangerous weapon, and nine counts of use of a firearm to commit murder during and in relation to a crime of violence. Roof also is scheduled to be tried on state murder charges, for which he could also be sentenced to death."
31642,31657,50423,Bag found in Lake Erie search for plane carrying 6,CNN,Phil Gast,1/3/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Boats, dive teams and a helicopter continue to scour Lake Erie for a small plane that is believed to have crashed after takeoff from a Cleveland area airport. Six people were on board the plane that vanished last week. Thus far, only a bag found in a harbor is confirmed to have belonged to the aircraft, Cleveland police said Monday. ”Over 120 pieces of debris were recovered so far and many are consistent with what would be found on a Cessna 525 Citation. We are not sharing any further information about the debris as it is part of an active investigation.” The search, which is to resume Tuesday morning, has been taking place in water 35 to 45 feet deep. While  conditions can be challenging, officials said they were favorable Monday. ”On even a calm, clear day you are going to get lucky . .. 4 to 6 foot visibility,” Mike Hendershot of the Lorain dive team told CNN affiliate WEWS. The plane was registered to John T. Fleming, a beverage company executive, and is based at Ohio State University Airport, the airport’s director told CNN on Friday.  Fleming’s father, John W. Fleming, told the Columbus Dispatch that his son was at the controls of the Cessna that went missing after the pilot, his family and friends attended a Cleveland Cavaliers basketball game on Thursday night. Also on board the plane were Fleming’s wife, Suzanne Fleming, 46, their two sons, John Robert, 15, and Andrew Thomas, 14, a neighbor and a neighbor’s daughter, the pilot’s father told the newspaper. John T. Fleming, an experienced pilot, was taking his family and neighbors to the Cavaliers game as a treat for the holidays, according to his father. Fleming is president and CEO of Superior Beverage Group, according to his LinkedIn page. University of   freshman Megan Casey, 19, and her father, Brian, were on the flight, the school said. ”In the short time she was on our campus, Megan was a friend to many and was pursuing a career in nursing,” said Dean of Students and Vice Provost for Student Life Lori Berquam. ”Our thoughts are with her family and friends.” Their Powell, Ohio, family described Megan and Brian Casey as ”loving, caring, remarkable individuals.” The last radar contact with the plane came as it flew about 2 miles north of Cleveland’s Burke Lakefront Airport, where it took off, according to US Coast Guard Capt. Michael Mullen.  The Citation 525 was headed for the university airport in Columbus when it disappeared from radar, a Coast Guard statement said. Air traffic control reported to the Coast Guard about 11:30 p. m. on Thursday that the plane had just taken off and ”dropped off radar about 2 miles when it was over Lake Erie,” Coast Guard Petty Officer 2nd Class Christopher Yaw told CNN."

And I also know things that other people don’t know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation,” he told reporters on New Year’s Eve. Asked to describe what undisclosed information he knew, Trump said: ”You’ll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday.” GOP senator: I’ll ’wait and see’ what Trump says on Russia’s role in hacking, Conway said the hacks have become an issue because Democrats lost the 2016 election. She added that Trump is expected to receive an intelligence briefing this week at Trump Tower. ”What I can say is that we don’t believe that intelligence efforts should interfere into politics, certainly,” she said. ”But we also don’t believe that politics should interfere with our intelligence.” The FBI and Department of Homeland Security released a report last week that they said ”provides technical details regarding the tools and infrastructure used by the Russian civilian and military intelligence services to compromise and exploit networks and endpoints associated with the US election.” The report added that the Russian hackers also have historically targeted ”a range of US government, political, and private sector entities” using similar tactics."

James Lankford said he will ”wait and see” what   Donald Trump knows about the Russian hacking in the United States. Trump stands apart from the US intelligence community over whether Russia was behind the hacking aimed at meddling with the US election. ”It could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don’t know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation,” he told reporters on New Year’s Eve. Asked to describe what undisclosed information he knew, Trump said: ”You’ll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday.” Adviser contradicts Trump: Russians hacked the US, Lankford, who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee told CNN’s Erin Burnett on ”OutFront” on Monday: ”He can come out on Tuesday and Wednesday and get a chance to present that out but at this point I want to just wait and see what that is.” Lankford added that he has doesn’t have ”any doubt” that Russia is responsible for the hacking. ”The Russians have been engaged in hacking for elections . .. all over Europe, all over Asia, all over their neighbors,” he said. ”I don’t have any doubt that it is from Russia,” he said. ”This meets the mode that they do all over the world and all over the region already.” On Monday, former CIA Director James Woolsey, an adviser to Trump on national security issues, told CNN’s Jim Sciutto that determining who was behind the hacks is difficult, but that he believes the Russians    and possibly others    were involved. ”I think the Russians were in there, but it doesn’t mean other people weren’t, too,” Woolsey said. ”It’s often not foolproof to say who it is because it is possible and sometimes easy to hide your tracks.

31646,31663,50429,Adviser contradicts Trump: Russians hacked the US,CNN,Barbara Starr,1/2/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN) A top adviser to   Donald Trump said Monday he thinks the Russians were involved in   hacking of the US    a very different view than that held by the incoming administration.  Former CIA director James Woolsey, an adviser to Trump on national security issues, told CNN’s Jim Sciutto that determining who was behind the hacks is difficult, but that he believes the Russians    and possibly others    were involved. ”I think the Russians were in there, but it doesn’t mean other people weren’t, too,” he said. ”It’s often not foolproof to say who it is because it is possible and sometimes easy to hide your tracks. There’s lots of tricks.” Asked if Trump is playing the media with his comments on who was culpable, Woolsey said it was a ”possibility,” noting that Trump is an ”expert in weaving around” on issues like this. ”Sometimes people may have been talking to somebody in the National Security Agency and have an idea that maybe it was one type of hacking rather than another,” he said. ”I don’t think this is of substantial matter. I think it’s basically just dialogue back and forth.” Speaking on Tuesday on CNN’s ”New Day,” Woolsey stressed his belief that more than one country was involved in hacking US Democratic organizations and individuals. ”Is it Russian? Probably some,” the Trump adviser told Chris Cuomo, adding that China and Iran could also have been involved. ”It shouldn’t be portrayed as one guilty party. It’s much  more complicated than that.” He added, ”This is not an organized an operation . .. It’s not like taking a number at a bakery and standing in line to politely get your dozen cookies . .. it’s more like a bunch of jackals at the carcass of an antelope.” Woolsey’s comments come even as Trump and his aides continue to cast doubt on the links between Russia and recent hacks against Democrats, while US intelligence officials say that newly identified ”digital fingerprints” indicate Moscow was behind the intrusions. One official told CNN the administration has traced the hack to the specific keyboards    which featured Cyrillic characters    that were used to construct the malware code, adding that the equipment leaves ”digital fingerprints” and, in the case of the recent hacks, those prints point to the Russian government. In response to the US information, Kremlin spokesman Dimitri Peskov told CNN: ”I don’t understand what this means exactly, but Cyrillic characters can be used everywhere. Once again, I reject any possibility that official Russia can be involved in any way.”  Despite an initial public assessment by the US intelligence community in October that Russia was behind the intrusions, Trump and his staff continue to voice doubts.  ”The idea that we’re jumping to conclusions before we have a final report is, frankly, irresponsible,” Trump’s incoming press secretary, Sean Spicer, told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota Monday. Trump expressed skepticism on New Year’s Eve, saying, ”I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else.” He also claimed to have inside information on the matter, which he said he would reveal later this week. Asked how Trump would be getting that type of information, Woolsey said on ”New Day” that people inside the US intelligence community may be reaching out for Trump. ”He could have people talking to him from within the system,” Woolsey said. Spicer said Trump was ”going to talk about his conclusions and where he thinks things stand,” adding the   would ”make sure people understand that there’s a lot of questions out there.” A second US official told CNN Monday there is increasingly confidence in the intelligence analysis, citing the ability to collect extremely   intel on Russia, compared the difficulty of doing so with more secretive regimes like North Korea. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security released a report last week that they said ”provides technical details regarding the tools and infrastructure used by the Russian civilian and military intelligence Services to compromise and exploit networks and endpoints associated with the US election.” The report added that the Russian culprits also have historically targeted ”a range of US Government, political, and private sector entities” using similar tactics. Spicer said Trump would await the results of the investigation ordered by President Barack Obama as he insisted that the assessments of the intelligence community published so far did not constitute the ”final report.”  He said Trump was expected to be briefed about that report in coming days.  Trump is facing mounting pressure to undertake a robust response to Russia’s activities, with Republican leaders in Congress saying that Obama’s recent   sanctions of Russian intelligence entities and expulsion of some Russians from the US don’t go far enough. ”It is clear that Russia has attacked the United States of America. All of our intelligence agencies will affirm that that’s been the case. We will work in the Congress to have stronger sanctions in order to prevent further attacks,” Republican Sen. John McCain said while in Georgia, a country that fought a war with Russia in 2008. McCain, who was also visiting NATO’s easternmost members in the Baltic region and the Ukraine, also promised to hold hearings into the   when Congress is back in session this month."
31647,31665,50431,Trump: Chicago mayor should ask feds to help combat homicides,CNN,Daniella Diaz,1/2/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN)  Donald Trump said Monday that Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel should seek federal assistance to combat homicides in the nation’s   city. ”Chicago murder rate is record setting   4, 331 shooting victims with 762 murders in 2016. If Mayor can’t do it he must ask for Federal help!” Trump tweeted. Trump’s tweet accurately relayed Chicago’s homicide numbers. And while they are not ”record setting,” The Chicago Tribune reports that homicides were up 60% from 2015 to the highest levels in 20 years. Emanuel, who was President Barack Obama’s chief of staff from January 2009 to October 2010, met with Trump in New York last month, urging the   to continue the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program until a modernized immigration system can be decided by Congress.   Emanuel’s administration said Monday it looks ”forward to working with” Trump on crime. ”As the   knows from his conversation with the mayor, we agree the federal government has a strong role to play in public safety by funding summer jobs and prevention programming for   youth, by holding the criminals who break our gun laws accountable for their crimes, by passing meaningful gun laws, and by building on the partnerships our police have with federal law enforcement,” said Adam Collins, Emanuel’s director of communications, in a statement following Trump’s tweet.  He added: ”We are heartened he is taking this issue seriously and look forward to working with the new administration on these important efforts.” The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment about what federal help his administration might offer Chicago to combat homicide. But California Republican Rep. Darrel Issa told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on ”The Situation Room” that Emanuel needs to communicate with Trump to combat crime. ”What Rahm needs to do is he does need to work with   Trump when he’s President and ask for the federal help that will allow him to break up these pockets of very bad people and let his police work on commuting policing,” he said. ”This combination works.” This isn’t the first time Trump has talked about Chicago’s crime rate. Often on the campaign trail, Trump would mention Chicago while suggesting that controversial tactics such as    could help address the issue. ”A policy like    could save thousands of lives in a city like Chicago, just like it saved thousands of lives in New York. Overwhelmingly, this will save   and Hispanic lives    citizens who are entitled to the same protections as every American,” Trump said during a September rally in Florida. While    policies are used in various US cities, the aggressive implementation of    in New York was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge in 2013, who said the policy violated the rights of minorities who were disproportionately targeted. The focus on Chicago homicides comes as Obama is set to deliver his farewell address to the nation on January 10 from his home city, he announced Monday. ”I’m thinking about them as a chance to say thank you for this amazing journey, to celebrate the ways you’ve changed this country for the better these past eight years, and to offer some thoughts on where we all go from here,” Obama said of his planned Chicago farewell speech.

31648,31667,50433,Prisoners decapitated in Brazil riot over drug turf,CNN,Euan McKirdy,1/2/17,2017,1,," (CNN) A   uprising at a prison in Brazil claimed the lives of at least 56 prisoners over the weekend,   media agency Agencia Brasil reported Monday.  Bodies were thrown over the wall of the complex, and at least six people were decapitated, the news agency reported.  The revolt started Sunday afternoon as part of a rivalry between two criminal organizations at the Anisio Jobim Prison Complex in the city of Manaus, Agencia Brasil reported, citing Sergio Fontes, the public safety secretary for the state of Amazonas. Violence erupted on Sunday between incarcerated members of the the Familia do Norte (FDN) and the Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC) groups. The riot lasted for more than 17 hours.  The FDN controls drug trafficking and the ”inside of prison complexes,” according to state media. Fontes said that the riot started over control of the drug trade behind the prison walls.  ”They weren’t fighting because one is called one thing and the other one is called another. They are fighting for money,” he said. ”There is a silent war going on, and the state must intervene. What is this war? Drug trafficking. What did we see today? One faction fighting with another.” Among the hostages were 74 prisoners and an unknown number of prison guards, Fontes said. Authorities said they did not know how many prisoners might have escaped from the complex. Separate prison break, As the riot raged, ”dozens” of prisoners orchestrated an escape from another Manaus prison, the Antonio Trindade Penal Institute (Ipat). Fontes speculated that the jailbreak could have been arranged as a ”smokescreen” for the Anisio Jobim riot, according to the Agencia Brasil report.  Prisoners also caused a ”commotion” at one other penitentiary, according to the Amazonas public security secretariat.  Security forces did not enter the Anisio Jobim complex due to the ”unpredictable” nature of the situation. According to Fontes, the riot ”was managed with negotiation and respect for the human rights.” He said said the riot instigators will be identified and held accountable for the murders and other crimes.  Extra funding requested, Alexandre de Moraes, Brazil’s justice minister, told reporters on Monday evening in Manaus, that the gang members responsible for the riot will be transferred to federal prisons. ”This is an important step to identify and remove those that headed this absurd riot on the first of the year,” he said. Following the New Year’s incident, the government of the state of Amazonas has called for federal support to combat drug trafficking and strengthen security in Brazil’s detention centers.   Fontes said the preliminary investigation suggests the riot was premeditated.  ”Everything indicates that the acts were planned over a long period of time,” he said.  ”The inmates had established with the administration (of the prison) a promise that everything would run smoothly throughout the holidays and there wouldn’t be any problems. They didn’t keep their promise, but you can’t expect much from criminals, can you?” The number of prisoners killed in Sunday’s incident is the highest since the deadly 1992 Carandiru massacre. In that case, 111 inmates died after police stormed the Carandiru penitentiary following a riot."
31649,31668,50434,How Trump can reshape the federal courts,CNN,Ariane de Vogue,1/2/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN) Donald Trump is poised to cement the conservative majority on the Supreme Court, but he will also play a critical role in reshaping the look of the lower courts as he moves to fill over 100 vacancies in the federal judiciary.  Experts say that the unusually high number of vacancies    due in part to judicial warfare between the Obama administration and the   Senate    could change the face of the courts.  ”If   Trump can put a different face on the Supreme Court and the Courts of Appeals he could substantially change the course of federal jurisprudence,” said Russell Wheeler of the Brookings Institution. As things stand now, there are 103 vacancies in the appeals and district courts. The Administrative Office of the US Courts defines 38 of those as judicial ”emergencies,” or those where vacancies have existed for an extended period of time in areas with a high number of filings. For comparison, President Barack Obama had 59 vacancies when he took office. A shift in the courts could impact   issues such as abortion, gun control, environmental protection and transgender rights.  To be sure, the current vacancies include seats that had been held by judges who were originally nominated by Republican presidents. It’s also true that a nominee doesn’t always fulfill the vision of the person who places him on the bench. But the large number gives Trump and unusual opportunity to make his mark on the judiciary.  ”Republicans in the 114th Senate confirmed an abnormally low number of judges creating an abnormally high number of vacancies for Trump to fill,” said Wheeler.  Although critics say that Obama was slow out of the gate in filling seats early in his tenure, by the end of his administration he had appointed 323 district and circuit court judges, according to Wheeler, slightly more than George W. Bush.  But he was also President when the Senate changed the rules. Frustrated by Republican efforts to block nominees, the Democrats triggered the so called ”nuclear option, which allowed the President’s judicial and executive nominees to be confirmed with only 51 votes. Supreme Court nominees are exempt from the change and still subject to the   threshold.  Perhaps the impact of the rules change was most evident on the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. After the ”nuclear option” eliminating the Senate filibuster, Obama pushed through three more nominees on that court which is often called the ”second most important court in the land” because it reviews actions by federal agencies.  ”Republicans resisted filling vacant seats on the Court of Appeals, arguing that the court didn’t need the judges. That was the straw that broke the camel’s back and led the Democrats to change the filibuster rules and shortly thereafter the Senate confirmed three pending nominees,” said Wheeler.  Trump’s task will be complicated by the fact that Senate leaders usually honor a   rule that home state senators of either party must approve a nominee before they process it."
31650,31669,50435,Istanbul attack: Teenager’s holiday trip ends in tragedy,CNN,,1/2/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Leanne Nasser begged her parents to let her go to Istanbul. She had never been abroad. Never left Israel. Her three friends were going to the city on the Bosporus to celebrate New Year’s Eve and she wanted to go with them. Her father refused. He was worried Istanbul wasn’t safe and he wanted her to stay home. Despondent, she turned to her aunt, Layal Masarweh, who intervened on her behalf.  ”Her father was totally against that. He was saying that Istanbul is too dangerous and that she should not go at all. But she insisted, saying that nothing will happen to her,” Masarweh told CNN.  Nasser, 18, from Tira, an Arab town in central Israel, had big plans for the future after finishing high school in June. She worked at a dental clinic and was saving to buy a car. She wanted to be a dentist one day. But first was New Year’s Eve and celebrating the start of 2017. The four women made their way to the Reina restaurant on the Bosporus in Istanbul. A few hours before midnight, she posted a picture to Snapchat. In it, she flashed a   a floral crown atop her long, dark hair. Her brown eyes looked straight at the camera. The following morning    after a terrorist opened fire inside the club, after 39 people were killed and dozens more injured, after emergency responders started working through the massacre    Nasser was missing. Her three friends were found    two were uninjured. One was in the hospital, having sustained moderate injuries in the attack, but she was in stable condition and was expected to recover. Nasser’s father caught the next flight to Turkey    a   flight from Tel Aviv. Hours passed as her family held out hope. She might have survived. She might be in a different hospital. She might be OK. At home in Tira, her uncle’s phone buzzed. It was her father. He had sent over some pictures. A   gold ring with specks of blood on the band. A necklace with purple and green gemstones. A silver purse with blood that had seeped between the sparkles. The authorities were wondering if her family could identify them. And her father couldn’t remember if they were Leanne’s. The uncle stared at the pictures for a moment. He showed the photos to Nasser’s aunt. There was no doubt anymore. They were Leanne’s. She had died in the attack. ”I cannot forgive myself,” said her aunt, Layal Masarweh.  ”I wish I was with her to defend her or do anything to save her life. I wish they took my soul and gave it to her.” Nasser’s body will be flown home on Tuesday, three days into 2017. Her family is waiting for her to come home. The tears have not stopped, and the grief is still too near. ”I still cannot believe it happened and that she was killed,” Masarweh said.  It was Leanne Nasser’s first trip abroad. And it will be her last trip home."
31651,31670,50436,"Alcohol abuse linked to higher heart risks, study says",CNN,,1/2/17,2017,1,," (CNN) An estimated 10 million to 15 million Americans abuse alcohol, meaning excessive drinking negatively affects their lives. Now, research suggests a link between too much drinking and heart problems, the No. 1 cause of death worldwide.  Abusing alcohol increases the likelihood of suffering atrial fibrillation, heart attack or congestive heart failure, according to a study published Monday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. ”One of the most surprising findings. .. is that people who abused alcohol are at increased risk for heart attack or myocardial infarction,” said Dr. Gregory M. Marcus, director of clinical research in the Division of Cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco and senior author of the study. Past data suggests that moderate drinking may be protective, he said, helping ward off this disease. Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, director of women’s heart health at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, believes that both scientists and the media have been highlighting the good components of alcohol, such as resveratrol in wine, and ”been really pushing that a glass of wine is good for our health.” But the bottom line of this new study is clear, she said. ”When we look at alcohol, we have almost glamorized it as being this substance that can help us live a really   life,” said Steinbaum, who was not involved in the research. ”I think, ultimately, drinking in excess leads to heart conditions, and we should really understand the potential toxicity of alcohol and not glamorize it as something we should include as part of our lives    certainly not in excess.” Millions of patient records, The National Institutes of Health frequently highlight the ways in which too much drinking can lead to accidents, cirrhosis and some cancers. Yet cardiovascular studies have suggested that moderate consumption of alcohol is good for our heart health.  The authors of the new study cite a 2007 study published in the journal Circulation. Not only did moderate drinking lead to no negative effects, the study authors concluded that ”moderate drinking may lower the risk of heart failure.”  Since many of us believe that ”more of a good thing is always better,” Marcus and his colleagues decided to investigate how excessive drinking might impact our risk of developing atrial fibrillation, or arrhythmic beating of the heart myocardial infarction, or heart attack and congestive heart failure, a chronic condition in which the heart cannot effectively push blood through the arteries and circulatory system to the body’s other organs and tissues.  For data, Marcus and his colleagues turned to the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project’s California State Ambulatory Surgery Databases, Emergency Department Databases and State Inpatient Databases. They looked at California residents, 21 or older, who had been hospitalized anytime between 2005 and 2009.  All told, Marcus and his team analyzed the medical records of 14, 727, 591 patients.  Of these, 1. 8% or approximately 268, 000, had been diagnosed with alcohol abuse. Marcus said there was no specific cutoff regarding a specific amount of alcohol or time period and admitted that this was a limitation of the study.  Within the study, then, alcohol abuse was defined as instances in which a health care provider flagged a patient as having a problem with excessive alcohol use, either ”acutely”   showing up for an appointment drunk, for example    or chronically    such as having an addiction or reliance on alcohol, explained Marcus. According to Dr. Scott Krakower, assistant unit chief of psychiatry at Zucker Hillside Hospital in New Hyde Park, New York, alcohol abuse is generally not dependence. Instead, it’s when ”you’re using it excessively at times and it’s getting in the way of functioning.” ”Abuse doesn’t necessarily lead to a pattern where you use it every day and you’re developing a tolerance or developing withdrawal symptoms,” said Krakower, who was not involved in the study. He added that alcohol abuse is when ”you start having problems with alcohol it might affect you physically, but it can also have social implications and psychological implications,” such as trouble with relationships or problems at work. Some heart risks double, In surveying the data on millions of patients, Marcus and his colleagues discovered that alcohol abuse was associated with atrial fibrillation, heart attack and heart failure.  Specifically, they found that alcohol abuse was associated with a doubled risk of atrial fibrillation, a 1.  higher risk of heart attack and a 2.  increased risk of congestive heart failure.  ”It didn’t matter if you had a conventional risk factor for these diseases or not. In every case, alcohol abuse increased the risk,” Marcus said. That said, Marcus and his colleagues discovered that the number of people who would develop either atrial fibrillation, heart attack or heart failure in three years was much higher if they had an established risk factor and abused alcohol. They also compared alcohol abuse to the conventional risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure and diabetes. ”In general, if someone abused alcohol, it appeared to increase the risk to a similar magnitude to other conventional risk factors,” Marcus said. Eliminating alcohol abuse would result in over 73, 000 fewer atrial fibrillation cases, 34, 000 fewer heart attacks and 91, 000 fewer patients with congestive heart failure in the US alone, the researchers estimated. Motivation to quit, When it comes to helping patients with alcohol abuse, Krakower said, primary care doctors can use the latest    guidance tools to screen patients and ”see if a person has a problem with alcohol and from there determine what level of intervention is necessary.” From there, Krakower said, treatment options include motivational interviewing, a type of therapy in which the goal is for a patient to ”find some motivation to quit.” There’s also group therapy,   therapy techniques and, of course, Alcoholics Anonymous. Still there are nuances when it comes to drinking. ”We have an understanding (by the American Heart Association) that a glass of wine a day for women and two glasses of wine a day for men are good,” Steinbaum said. ”What is a glass? Four to 6 ounces.”  Yet if you go out to dinner and order a glass of wine, she said with a laugh, ”it’s like 12 ounces!” The exact equation of how much is too much has never really been answered, and ”part of the reason for that is metabolism is different in everyone,” Steinbaum said. Metabolism of alcohol is slower for women than for men, and individual fat distribution and muscle mass also play into how quickly alcohol is metabolized.  ”It becomes a very individual thing,” she said. ”The American Heart Association has given us very conservative guidelines, saying if you’re going to drink, this is how much but the big picture is alcohol in excess    and excess is more than a very minimal amount    is bad for your heart.” Still, no matter the characteristics of any individual patient, excessive alcohol is an important risk factor for atrial fibrillation and heart failure, Marcus said: ”Increasing awareness of this both among practitioners and individuals may actually reduce or prevent those important diseases.”"
31652,31672,50438,Broncos head coach Gary Kubiak retires,CNN,Jill Martin,1/2/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Less than a year after winning the Super Bowl, Gary Kubiak is leaving his position as Denver Broncos head coach. At a press conference on Monday, an emotional Kubiak said that he was retiring from coaching because the demands of the job were becoming too much for him. ”Coaching is a very demanding business,” he said. ”Tough business. And I’ve always prided myself. You know, I’ve been a head coach for 10 years. And each of us as coaches. .. we all have a routine. We all have a way we go about doing things, and I’ve had my routine for a long time. And I’ve always taken a lot of pride that I could coach a football team, be there for the players, be there for the coaches, be there for the organization, do a game plan, call some plays on Sunday. I’ve always taken a lot of pride in the fact that I could do all of those things. ”But this year I haven’t been able to do that. It’s been tough. And for the first time I’ve had to tell myself, ’Hey, you can’t do that anymore. ’” Kubiak, 55, has had more than one health scare in his career. He missed Denver’s game on October 13 against the San Diego Chargers because of a complex migraine condition. When he was head coach of the Houston Texans, Kubiak suffered a transient ischemic attack    commonly known as a      when he collapsed during a game in 2013. Kubiak said he didn’t immediately start thinking of retirement after his medical emergency in October. ”That was obviously an episode that took place, and I’ve had a couple in the last four years, but it wasn’t like, ’OK, this is something that I can’t handle,’” he said. ”I wouldn’t say that. It was a struggle for me throughout the course of the year just keeping up with the things that I normally do and the way I want to do them. . .. It was not one incident, but I am listening to the last few years.” Broncos general manager John Elway said Kubiak approached him about a week ago to talk about stepping down. Elway said that Kubiak, a Broncos teammate in their playing days, asked him to have a conversation as his friend instead of as his boss. Elway said he has mixed emotions about Kubiak leaving and acknowledged he checked to see whether he would change his mind and come back. But as a friend, Elway said he understood Kubiak’s decision. ”In the long run, it’s the right thing for Gary, and I think that’s the most important thing,” Elway said. Kubiak was   in his two seasons as Denver’s coach. Last season, Kubiak led Denver to a   win in Super Bowl 50 in February against the Carolina Panthers. Following the win, however, the Broncos took a step back. Quarterback Peyton Manning retired, and his backup, Brock Osweiler, left for the Houston Texans.

31653,31673,50439,Blue states should take Trump’s tax cut money and run,CNN,,1/2/17,2017,1,," (CNN) A few days after winning the presidency, Donald Trump visited Manhattan’s posh 21 Club and told the swells dining there, ”We’ll get your taxes down. Don’t worry about it.”  So far he seems intent on following through. Congressional Republicans are working on a   plan that in practice would benefit the   . And Trump’s pick of spending hawk Mick Mulvaney to head the Office of Budget and Management suggests that government programs may indeed be slashed to make such tax cuts palatable to fiscal conservatives.   Democratic lawmakers representing liberal parts of America habitually denounce this sort of thing: Spending reductions combined with tax cuts benefiting upper incomes. The question is, ”should they?” and the answer is ”no.” The blue states should take the money and run.   The time has come for liberals to recognize that the Republican agenda    which they have little control over anyway    can work to their advantage. Who gets the least return on the money they send to Washington? The economically successful blue states. Which states most depend on federal spending?  The poorer red ones.   Most of the proposed federal tax reforms would leave more wealth in the affluent blue states. They could capture some of it through their own taxes and economic activity unleashed by residents with more money in their pockets. Repealing Obamacare alone would deliver tax cuts totaling $346 billion over 10 years, every penny going to households making $200, 000 or more. Interesting that the 12 states with the largest percentage of such households all voted for Hillary Clinton.  No more universal health coverage?  Not necessarily. Massachusetts has Romneycare, a wildly popular   system that served as a model for the Affordable Care Act.  Insurers there expect little upheaval from an Obamacare repeal.   Massachusetts, by the way, has the strongest economy in the country, according to Governing magazine. California’s   insurance exchange is in good shape, notes Nicholas Bagley, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School.  California could simply adopt its own individual mandate as Obamacare does. Requiring everyone to buy coverage (or pay a fine) brings healthy people into the insurance pools. Having the young and hearty subsidize the sick and elderly keeps the pools stable. Connecticut, New York, Oregon and Washington are in especially good positions to do likewise, Bagley says. Trump’s choice of Scott Pruitt, a   denialist, to head the Environmental Protection Agency alarms environmentalists. So does Peter Navarro as head of a new White House trade council.  Navarro has accused NASA of ”politically correct environmental monitoring” of climate change through its   satellites.  No matter.  ”If Trump turns off the satellites, ” Gov. Jerry Brown said, ”California will launch its own damn satellite.” Given California’s lead in confronting climate change, we can well believe that Brown, who heads the world’s fifth biggest economy, would follow through on that promise.  You can bet that the work to build the satellites would almost all land in California.  In 2004, California set   standards higher than the federal government’s.  Twelve other states followed California’s lead and after an unsuccessful suit to stop the stricter standards, the auto industry came around.   In 2010, California required that 33% of its electricity come from renewable energy sources by 2020. It was recently raised to 50% by 2030. Now 30 states have renewable energy requirements.  ”  ” is a   approach to cutting emissions of   greenhouse gases. When Congress failed to pass    legislation, California set up its own system. As of this writing, 10 states have done likewise.  This isn’t just environmental  . It is economic development. Almost 60% of all   venture capital in the United States ends up in California.  The federal income tax has been called a   tax because the higher incomes tend to cluster in Democratic strongholds. What’s especially unfair about this is the federal tax code does not account for cost of living, which is highest in the elite coastal cities.   Someone making $90, 000 in Houston would have to pull in $162, 000 to live as well in San Francisco, according to BankRate’s calculator.  Yet, all else being equal, the San Franciscan pays far more taxes to the federal government than the Houstonian. There’s no reason why   states can’t get together and solve problems, including local challenges and international ones like climate change. For the richer blue states, a reduced federal tax burden would leave them with the added means to address these challenges.  And the nicest part: They can spend the money at home. "
31654,31675,50441,Dylann Roof: ’There’s nothing wrong with me psychologically’,CNN,Martin Savidge,1/4/17,2017,1,,"Charleston, South Carolina (CNN) Convicted Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof began making his case in court Wednesday, addressing jurors for the first time as they weigh whether to give him a death sentence. ”There’s nothing wrong with me psychologically,” Roof said during his brief opening statement. Three people who’d been sitting in the section of the courtroom reserved for friends and family of the victims walked out while Roof spoke. One said, ”This is all crap,” as he left. Roof, wearing a gray knit sweater and speaking so softly that people in the courtroom strained to hear him, told jurors to disregard the arguments his attorneys made in the earlier phase of the trial. ”Anything you heard from my lawyers in the last phase, I ask you to forget it,” he said. ”That’s the last thing.” Prosecutor details Roof’s jailhouse journal, Last month jurors convicted Roof of federal murder and hate crimes charges for the June 2015 massacre at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.  Now the white supremacist who killed nine people at the historically black church is representing himself in court as the jury decides whether he will face life in prison or the death penalty. Assistant US Attorney Nathan Williams argued Wednesday that a number of factors show Roof deserves a death sentence. Among them: the avowed white supremacist’s motive, his lack of remorse and the shooting’s impact on the victims’ families. ”The defendant didn’t stop after shooting one or four or five people. That’s why this case is worse,” Williams said. ”He killed because of the color of their skin. He thought they were less as people. He wanted to magnify and incite violence.” The prosecutor presented new evidence, including a jailhouse journal that he said was written six weeks after Roof’s arrest.  ”I do not regret what I did,” the journal entry said, according to Williams. ”I am not sorry. I have not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed. I do feel sorry for the innocent white children forced to live in this sick county. I do feel sorry for the innocent white people that are killed daily at the hands of the lower races. I have shed a tear of   for myself. I feel pity that I had to do what I did in the first place. I feel pity that I had to give up my life because of a situation that should never have existed.” The journal entry echoes racist statements from Roof that prosecutors presented earlier in the trial.  But the jailhouse writings reveal something significant, Williams argued. Roof, the prosecutor said, is capable of remorse    but felt none for his crimes.  Family, friends of victims testify, Also on Wednesday, the jury began hearing from people who lost relatives or friends in the massacre. Jennifer Pinckney, widow of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney,  was in a nearby room with a daughter when the shooting occurred. She testified about her relationship with her husband and about the shooting.  When police arrived, a female officer told the daughter they were going to play a game, Pinckney said. The officer encouraged the girl to put her head on her shoulder and keep her eyes closed.  But Jennifer Pinckey was unable to avoid catching a glimpse of the scene. She said she was walking to the door when she saw blood on the floor.  ”I felt sick,” she said. ”I leaned over and they rushed me out.” She believes she survived to continue her husband’s legacy. ”He did so much. And he was so many things to so many people,” she said. Some of the most emotional testimony came from the Rev. Anthony Thompson, whose wife, Myra, was killed. ”Gone. What am I here for if she’s gone? There’s nothing left for me to do now. The person I live for is gone,” he said before only his weeping could be heard in the courtroom. At one point, Roof objected to   members testifying, saying too many people were speaking. The judge denied his objection. Some family members of victims have appeared torn over whether Roof should be sentenced to death. Federal death row, Roof also is scheduled to be tried on state murder charges, for which he could also be sentenced to death. Only three federal inmates have been executed in the United States since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988 after a   moratorium: • Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh on June 11, 2001, six years after he killed 168 people. • Juan Raul Garza on June 19, 2001, eight years after he was convicted of running a marijuana drug ring and killing three people. • Louis Jones on March 18, 2003, eight years after he kidnapped and murdered    Army Pvt. Tracie McBride. Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was the last person to get a federal death sentence. He’s one of 62 federal prisoners awaiting execution, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a   nonprofit. "
31655,31676,50442,Israeli soldier convicted of manslaughter,CNN,Oren Liebermann,1/4/17,2017,1,,"Tel Aviv, Israel (CNN) An Israeli military court convicted an Israeli soldier of manslaughter Wednesday in the fatal shooting of a wounded Palestinian knife attack suspect. The Palestinian, Abdel Fattah   21, was one of two men accused of stabbing another Israeli soldier in the West Bank city of Hebron in March. Charges were brought against Sgt. Elor Azaria after video footage emerged showing him shooting Sharif in the head as he lay on the ground, injured and already subdued.  The second Palestinian suspect had already been shot dead. The case against Azaria has divided opinion among the Israeli public, politicians and members of the military, and focused attention on the military’s code of ethics. The shooting came at the height of a wave of Palestinian stabbing and ramming attacks, amid criticism that Israeli soldiers were too quick to pull the trigger in response, often killing the assailants. Human rights organizations say Israeli soldiers rarely face discipline for violence against Palestinians. Azaria became the lightning rod for that criticism. Hundreds of supporters protested on Azaria’s behalf outside the Tel Aviv courtroom where the trial was held, and senior politicians have called for him to be pardoned.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday added his voice to those in favor of a pardon. On his Facebook page, Netanyahu wrote, ”(T) his is a difficult and painful day    first and foremost for Elor, his family, many citizens and parents of soldiers, among them me.” But the Israeli minister of defense said that the military would respect the verdict even if there were those who didn’t like it. Azaria was serving in Hebron, a majority Palestinian area in the West Bank, when he shot Sharif. The Israeli soldier who had been attacked suffered a minor injury. According to the Israel Defense Forces, Azaria arrived at the scene about 11 minutes after the attack, cocked his rifle and shot Sharif in the head, killing him. Azaria denied the charges against him. But a   panel of military judges was unanimous in finding him guilty of manslaughter and improper conduct. Packed courtroom, At the heart of the case was the motivation for the soldier’s actions. Azaria’s defense argued he felt his life was in danger, while the prosecution contended he was motivated by malice and vengeance. In a lengthy explanation before the verdict was delivered, the judges rejected all the defense arguments. The head judge, Col. Maya Heller, said that Azaria was an ”unreliable” witness and that his defense witnesses were also problematic. She called the shooting ”needless.” Azaria’s attorneys have promised to appeal the conviction.  About 50 people packed Courtroom A inside the heavily guarded Ministry of Defense as they waited for the verdict to be read.  On one side of the aisle sat Azaria’s family. On the other sat the media. Four members of the prosecution, dressed in uniform, waited across from Azaria’s defense team, dressed in suits.  Family members gave Azaria reassuring hugs and pats on the back. His mother held him tightly. Emotional scenes followed when the verdict was finally announced. After the judges walked out, Azaria’s mother screamed, ”You should be ashamed of yourselves.”  Protesters chant, ’Our soldier, the hero’  Across the street from the Ministry of Defense compound, several hundred supporters gathered behind a police security barrier.  They danced and cheered, shouting, ”Our soldier, the hero.”  Some waved Israeli flags and homemade signs that read, ”Today: Azaria Tomorrow: Your son.” Other signs said, ”The nation is with you!” The IDF said in a statement that it respected the court verdict and would study its implications, while giving Azaria and his family all the support they need. ”The IDF judicial system will continue to act towards revealing the truth, with independence and professionalism, in any case of suspected wrongdoing by the IDF and its soldiers,” the statement said. But others, mostly politicians on the right, have argued that Azaria’s actions were justified and that he should never have faced prosecution for killing a terror suspect. Naftali Bennett, the Israeli education minister and Jewish Home party leader, called for an ”immediate” pardon in a post on Facebook, saying the process had been ”contaminated from the start.” Miri Regev, Israel’s culture and sports minister, said she would ”work to pardon” the convicted soldier. ”This was a trial that should never have begun,” Regev, a former brigadier general and spokeswoman for the IDF, wrote in a Facebook post.  ’Positive step’ However, human rights groups hailed the verdict. In a statement, Amnesty International said the conviction was ”a rare occurrence in a country with a long record of using excessive and unwarranted force,” and that it ”offers a small glimmer of hope amid the rampant impunity for unlawful killings” in the Palestinian territories. Sari Bashi, Israel advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said, ”Today’s conviction is a positive step toward reining in excessive use of force by Israeli soldiers against Palestinians.” Rights organization Adalah    the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel said the conviction was ”the exception to the rule and stands unique in the long history of impunity enjoyed by Israeli armed forces.”"
31656,31677,50443,WikiLeaks’ Assange: Russia didn’t give us emails,CNN,Euan McKirdy,1/4/17,2017,1,," (CNN) WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has repeated his claim that the Russian government was not the source of hacked Democratic campaign emails his organization released before the US presidential election. The Obama administration, citing US intelligence sources, has accused Russia of orchestrating the hacking of emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta in an attempt to influence the election’s outcome.  The administration says it is ”100% certain” about Russian involvement, but   Donald Trump has frequently cast doubt on the veracity of the claims.  In an interview that aired Tuesday on Fox News’ ”Hannity,” Assange was asked if WikiLeaks’ source of the hacked material was ”Russia or anyone associated with Russia.” ”Our source is not a state party. So the answer    for our interactions    is no,” Assange told anchor Sean Hannity from his quarters at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he has lived under diplomatic protection since 2012.  Pressed on the source of the emails leaked by WikiLeaks in the weeks and months leading up to the November election, Assange repeated, ”Our source is not the Russian government. It is not state parties.” He was not asked directly if he believed Russia orchestrated the hacking. What Trump tweets vs. What Trump means, Palin: All is forgiven, Reacting to the Hannity interview, 2008 US vice presidential candidate and   Fox News contributor Sarah Palin, once a vociferous opponent of WikiLeaks, posted an apology to Assange on Facebook.  ”This important information (the emails) that finally opened people’s eyes to democrat candidates and operatives would not have been exposed were it not for Julian Assange,” she wrote.  ”I apologize for condemning Assange when he published my infamous (and proven noncontroversial, relatively boring) emails years ago. ”Julian, I apologize.” Trump weighed in on Twitter on Wednesday morning, saying ”Julian Assange said ’a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta    why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info!” As with Palin’s   the  ’s citation of the WikiLeaks founder represents a markedly different attitude toward the whistleblowing organization.  CNN’s KFile uncovered a 2010 interview with Trump, in which Fox News anchor Brian Kilmeade brought up the topic of WikiLeaks. At the time, WikiLeaks had published hundreds of thousands of classified documents and videos that were leaked to the organization by Pfc Chelsea Manning, known at the time as Pfc Bradley Manning. Speaking on camera to preview Kilmeade’s radio show,  Trump said: ”I think it’s disgraceful, I think there should be like death penalty or something,” during the quick exchange.  Assange denies contact with Putin, Trump campaign, Assange also denied talking to Russian President Vladimir Putin, his surrogates or anyone associated with the Trump campaign.  He suggested that President Barack Obama was ”acting like a lawyer” with the hacking allegations. ”If you look at most of his statements, he doesn’t say . .. WikiLeaks obtained its information from Russia, worked with Russia.” He said the content of the emails that WikiLeaks published was germane to the US election and the concerns of the electorate, and dominated much of the election cycle in the weeks leading up to November 8.  ”Was (the leaked information) influential? Did it have a lot of influence? Statistically, yes. It was the No. 1 topic on Facebook throughout October. The No. 1 (political) topic on Twitter, also, throughout October.  ”Did it change the outcome? Who knows. It’s absolutely impossible to tell.” Trump says he has inside information on hacking, Assange open to publishing Trump leaks if available, Assange also told Hannity he would have ”absolutely” released information about Trump and his campaign if he had received it.  He added that the White House’s ”dramatic response,” directly accusing Russia of orchestrating the hacks, is an attempt to ”delegitimize” Trump’s presidency, something he believes the defeated party will continue to do.  ”(The Democratic Party) will seize on this and harp on it for the next four years,” he said.  Trump, the computer and email skeptic in chief"
31657,31678,50444,Chuck Schumer: Trump opposition leader,CNN,Dana Bash,1/4/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Chuck Schumer arrived for his first day as Senate Democratic leader to a large, new Capitol suite still strewn with unpacked boxes. ”It’s a little fancier than I’m used to, but it goes with the territory,” Schumer told us, as he sat down for his maiden television interview as the Senate’s top Democrat. Schumer was hoping to be the new Democratic Senate majority leader, working with Hillary Clinton in the White House. Instead, he is leading the Trump opposition. The former would have been more fun, he conceded, but he says being minority leader now is ”more important.” Here’s how he described a recent phone conversation with Donald Trump: ”I said, ’Mr.   you went after both the Democratic and Republican establishments when you ran you were an   change candidate. But by your Cabinet picks and your early pronouncements, you seem to be embracing your timeworn,   hard right,’” he recalled. ”If you do that, your presidency will not come close to being a success,” he told Trump. For Schumer, success will be even more complicated. He has to walk a very fine line between when to work with Trump, and when to oppose him. Schumer describes it as ”accountability.” ”The only way we’re going to work with him is if he moves completely in our direction and abandons his Republican colleagues,” Schumer said. Schumer: ’We’re not compromising for its own sake’ ” % of the time, we’ll be holding his feet to the fire, holding him accountable. But we’re Democrats, we’re not going to just oppose things to oppose them,” he added. Schumer started his congressional career in the House in 1981, and served there until successfully defeating longtime Republican Sen. Alfonse D’Amato in 1998. He climbed the Democratic ranks as a fierce partisan and prolific fundraiser, but in recent years turned his attention to also becoming a successful legislator who can work across the aisle. He played a key role in crafting bipartisan Senate immigration reform in 2013, though the bill stalled in the House and never became law. Schumer loves being the center of deal making, a lot like the incoming president.   ”Well, here’s the problem. The Republicans in the Senate and the House have been run by a hard right group,” said Schumer. Schumer: I wish we hadn’t triggered ’nuclear option’ But what about now that they have a dealmaker in the White House? ”Look, we’re going to look at the specifics,” Schumer said. ”And on the overwhelming bunch of it, particularly given who he’s chosen as his Cabinet people, we’re going to have to oppose him because we just disagree in principle.”  ”Of course I’d like to make a deal,” he added. Many progressives scoff at the notion of Schumer even considering any form of compromise with Trump. Democracy for America, a leading progressive group, said: ”Democratic leaders from Chuck Schumer down need to stop playing footsie with Trump and pretending we can find.” Schumer’s response: ”We’re playing no footsie. My views are exactly the same as Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.”  ”If we can work with him and be true to our principles, we’re not going to reject him. But overall, we’re sticking to our principles,” he said.  The two New Yorkers have a history. Schumer says he doesn’t know Trump well, but he was one Schumer’s of early political donors. Schumer confirmed New York Post reporting that the   told him he likes him better than GOP leaders.  The new Democratic leader said he wasn’t surprised, but also not flattered. ”When you get to be in my position, people do tend to want to flatter you and you’ve got to take it with a grain of salt,” he said. Trump is hardly Schumer’s only concern. He’s also going to be the de facto leader of the movement to fix the defeated Democratic Party. Schumer confirms Trump told him he likes him better than Republicans, ”What we have to do is look at this election in the eye and see what we did wrong. I think we know what we did wrong. We have always been a party with a   economic message that talks about helping the middle class and people who want to get to the middle class get there more easily. We didn’t have that in this election,” Schumer said. ”So that even though Trump’s positions were much further away from where the middle class is and what they want, he seemed to be the person talking to them.” The New York Democrat says he will help his party craft what he calls a ”focused and   message.” ”And here’s the good news. Some people say, ’Which direction do you go in? The old Obama coalition or the new blue collar?’ If we have a   economic message, it unites our party. It unites Joe Manchin (a West Virginia moderate) to Bernie Sanders (a Vermont liberal) both of whom are on my leadership team,” Schumer said.  ”It unites the   worker in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the college student paying her loans in Los Angeles, the single mom in Harlem who’s on minimum wage,” he said, seeming to take the message for a  . It may be just the task for the man who put himself on the political map in the1980s by being media savvy. It was then that he realized that Sundays were a great day to make news (especially the New York Times) so he started holding regular Sunday news conferences. In the 1990s, one of the running jokes in Washington was that the most dangerous place in to be in the District was between Schumer and a television camera (Schumer says it was originally former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole’s line after Schumer used his publicity prowess to push through the Brady gun law). But that’s no longer true. Over the past several years, Schumer has tried to be more disciplined. He’s more likely to either be on his cell phone in the Capitol hallways, or pretend to be, in order to avoid talking to reporters, ”In the early days, the press was a very good way to bring out problems that needed to be fixed. Now, I have other levers of power, so I’m hardly inaccessible. And you can say a lot of bad things about Chuck Schumer and accessibility is never going to be one of them,” Schumer said with a knowing laugh. The same goes for authenticity. Though he proudly declared that he bought a new suit for his first day as leader, he is clearly still the same rumpled guy who slept for   years on a mattress next to the kitchen in a rundown group house owned by former Rep. George Miller. He now lives in an apartment, which is why he told us he is excited to have a large balcony outside his Capitol office. ”We’re going to try to find out if we can have barbeques,” Schumer said with genuine excitement. After a few more minutes, the New Yorker told us he had to get back to work. After all, he laughed, he can’t spend all his time doing press."
31658,31679,50445,Trump derides intel briefing on ’so-called’ Russian hacking,CNN,Jeremy Diamond,1/4/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN)  Donald Trump took to Twitter Tuesday evening to deride the US intelligence agencies due to brief him on alleged Russian hacking of American political groups. It was his latest attack on a key body he will rely on as commander in chief and again put him at odds with the agencies’ unanimous conclusion that Russia hacked Democratic Party groups and individuals to interfere in the US presidential election. Trump suggested that intelligence officials postponed an ” ’intelligence’ briefing on   ’Russian hacking’ ” that they were set to deliver to him this week because they might need more time ”to build a case.” He called the alleged delay ”very strange.” Trump tweeted Wednesday, ”Julian Assange said ’a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta’   why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info!” Trump said last week that he would receive an intelligence briefing on the Russian breaches this week and suggested it would come early on, telling reporters on New Year’s Eve that they would know more about the subject ”Tuesday or Wednesday.” But US intelligence officials disputed Trump’s tweet alleging a delay. Top US intelligence officials have been scheduled to brief Trump on the full report on Russian hacking President Barack Obama ordered once it was completed, but the meeting was not set to take place until later in the week, according to US officials. The meeting was never scheduled for Tuesday, as even Obama has yet to receive the   briefing on the Russian hacking, one US official said. And a US intelligence official told CNN that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper was never scheduled to be in New York City, where Trump is, on Tuesday    and was perplexed about the ”delay” Trump claimed was taking place. Trump on Tuesday did receive a classified intelligence briefing    the Presidential Daily Briefing    which Trump has elected to receive only sporadically. But it did not dive deeply into the Russian hacking. WikiLeaks’ Assange: Russia didn’t give us emails, US officials briefed on the matter said Clapper, National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers, FBI Director James Comey and CIA Director John Brennan are scheduled to attend the meeting with Trump providing him details on the Russian hacking. While Obama met with the heads of US intelligence agencies in his first weeks as   Trump has yet to do so eight weeks after he was elected, which US officials said was due to Trump’s scheduling conflicts. Instead, the   has repeatedly questioned their assessment of Russian cyber activity. Before the election, when 17 US intelligence agencies issued a public statement concluding that Russia orchestrated the hack of the Democratic National Committee, Trump immediately cast doubt on those conclusions, arguing it was impossible to distinguish between a Russian government operative and ”somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.” After Obama then slapped a series of sanctions on Russia, Trump issued a statement calling for the country to ”move on to bigger and better things” and then tweeted praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin for not retaliating against the sanctions. Trump continued his skepticism on New Year’s Eve, telling reporters once again that it ”could be somebody else.” ”I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove,” he said. He added that he also knows ”things that other people don’t know, so they can’t be sure of the situation.” On Tuesday, Russia again denied intervening in the US election campaign.  Reacting to a US intelligence official who told CNN the administration traced the hack to specific keyboards, which featured Cyrillic characters, Kremlin spokesman Dimitri Peskov said: ”I don’t understand what this means exactly but Cyrillic characters can be used everywhere.”  ”Once again I reject any possibility that official Russia can be involved in any way,” he added.  In December, Peskov said it was ”indecent” of the US to ”groundlessly” accuse Russia of intervention in the US election campaign. "
31659,31680,50446,Why are Russian warships in Philippines?,CNN,Brad Lendon,1/4/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Two Russian warships arrived in the Philippines this week as Moscow looks to play a bigger role in the contested South China Sea. The Russian destroyer Admiral Tributs and the sea tanker Boris Butomato, arrived in Manila on Tuesday for what the Philippine Navy termed a goodwill visit. Philippine Navy public affairs officer Lued Lincuna said there would be no joint exercises in the next five days, however, the idea of future joint exercises is under discussion. According to a report from Russia’s   Sputnik News, Russian Navy Rear Adm. Eduard Mikhailov said the Russian ships would be conducting joint exercises with Philippine forces to fight maritime piracy and terrorism. The Sputnik report termed the exercises ”an unprecedented    contact” between Russia and the Philippines. A report from the Russian website RT. com, however, said the ”Russian marines are expected to discuss and share tactics” with an eye toward future joint exercises. Any snap naval exercises between the two are unlikely, said Carl Schuster, a professor at Hawaii Pacific University and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center. He said the Russian Navy uses a unique signaling system which makes communication difficult with other navies when operating in the close proximity needed in exercises. ”Maneuvering naval ships in close proximity can lead to costly collisions if there is any misunderstanding about the signaled maneuver and speed,” Schuster said in an email to CNN. The Philippines is a former US territory and longtime US ally whose ties with Washington have become strained since President Rodrigo Duterte took office. Duterte has said his country could look to Russia for military support, including arms purchases, as relations with Washington have soured. Mikhailov said Russia would look to increase involvement in the South China Sea, where islands and shoals are subject to competing claims from China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam and Brunei. But Mikailov said Russia could be involved in joint military exercises that involved not only the Philippines, but also China and Malaysia, according to the Sputnik report. ”Maintaining the involvement of these regional partners is crucial for ensuring the stability of the South China Sea, where competing territorial claims continue to fuel geopolitical tensions,” the Sputnik report said. Tensions in the area have ratcheted up in the past two years as China has reclaimed land in massive dredging operations in the Spratly Islands, turning sandbars into islands equipped with airfields, weapons systems, ports and lighthouses. Russian ships, including the Admiral Tributs, staged joint   exercises with Chinese units in the South China Sea last September. China continued to highlight its South China Sea presence this week, announcing that its lone aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, had been conducting drills involving   fighter jets and helicopters, according to a report from the   Xinhua news agency. The agency’s website featured a gallery of photos from the exercises. The South China Sea are the latest in a cruise of the Liaoning that saw it venture into the open Pacific for the first time in late December. The Pacific leg of the cruise took the carrier and its escorts past Japan and Taiwan, both of which took notice. ”The threat of our enemy is growing day by day. We should always be maintaining our combat alertness,” said Taiwan Defense Minister Feng  . ”We are taking notice of this event, which indicates China is expanding its ability to engage in maritime warfare,” Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said.

31660,31682,50448,Man with knife attacks Chinese kindergarten,CNN,Steven Jiang,1/4/17,2017,1,,"Beijing (CNN) A man with a knife climbed over the wall of a kindergarten in China and attacked 11 students, according to Chinese state media.  No children sustained   injuries, according to police. The attack happened in the southwestern city of Pingxiang in the province of Guangxi. A    suspect has been caught, but his motives remain unclear, state media reported. Knife attacks at schools in China are common. Last year, a man in the southern province of Hainan stabbed 10 children before killing himself, authorities said.  And another man killed three students at a school in 2014 before jumping off a building. 2012: China attack illustrates U.

China’s Ministry of Education responded to those events by ordering schools to beef up security and bar strangers from going on campuses.

31661,31683,50449,"If Democrats delay action on Trump nominees, America suffers",CNN,,1/4/17,2017,1,," (CNN) If acceptance is the last stage of grief, Democrats have a way to go before they’ll get over this election. From the moment the blue wall crumbled and formerly safe states flipped to Donald Trump, the left has had a tenuous grasp on political reality. Rather than accepting that Trump will be the President on January 20, many have instead jumped from one desperate strategy to another in an effort to overturn the will of the American voters.  It began with Jill Stein’s   recount, a more than $7 million boondoggle that ended up netting more votes for the  . Some on the left then turned to an unseemly campaign,  ranging from celebrity videos to threats of violence, to persuade electors to ignore the voters in their states and cast their ballots for someone, anyone, other than Donald Trump.  With these efforts failed and Trump’s inauguration but days away, Democrats have taken up a new strategy: They will cripple the American government before they’ll see Donald Trump lead it.  As reported in the Washington Post,  Democratic Party leaders, well aware that they lack the votes in the Senate to defeat Trump’s Cabinet choices, have vowed to delay them for as long as possible, saying they want to see more information from the nominees on their personal finances. If successful, Democrats may prevent Trump from filling critical posts in government, from secretary of state to the United States attorney general, until March or beyond.  This strategy is an ”unprecedented break with Senate tradition.” Certainly, Republicans and Democrats have been guilty of holding up confirmation hearings for nominees before, but this tactic usually comes into play later in an administration. Both parties, no matter how contentious the election and no matter how disliked the victor, have refused to put the continuity of government at risk over petty partisanship. One need look no further back than 2009 for an example of this principle in action.   Before Barack Obama even stepped foot in the Oval Office, Republican leaders vowed to oppose much of his agenda. But when President Obama nominated Eric Holder for attorney general, Republicans gave him a vote and he was confirmed on February 2.   The Senate confirmed Hillary Clinton as secretary of state on January 21, the day after President Obama took the oath of office.  Republicans could have pulled any number of parliamentary tricks to delay the confirmation of two people whom they had every reason to oppose. But they didn’t, and for good reason. The secretary of state and attorney general are two of the most important positions in government. The first is responsible for our nation’s foreign policy, the second for upholding the rule of law.  Ensuring that the men and women nominated to fill these and other Cabinet positions are qualified is one of the Senate’s primary tasks, one enshrined in the Constitution itself. And Democrats should do their job. Ask tough questions. Hold thorough hearings. And if necessary, vote against the nominees.  But to delay the swift and orderly transition of government out of pure petty partisanship should be unacceptable to Democrats and Republicans alike. And that is exactly what Senate Democrats are threatening to do. Allowing the ship of state to run adrift or for the nation’s chief law enforcement agency to go without a leader is shameful, but worse than that, it threatens American lives both at home and abroad.  Losing is never easy, and losing this election was certainly harder than most. So Democrats can be forgiven for overreacting. But some tantrums go too far. Donald Trump will be president. Nothing is going to change that fact. And if Democrats don’t realize that soon, the results of the 2018 election may be even more difficult for them to swallow."

31663,31685,50451,Why four eyes are better than two,CNN,,1/4/17,2017,1,," (CNN) In hindsight I suppose it was unsurprising and perhaps somewhat inevitable that it was Elton John who really taught me about eyeglasses.  Dylan Jones is the    of GQ and the Chairman of London Fashion Week Men’s, About fifteen years ago I found myself at the house in Windsor that Elton shares with his long term partner David Furnish. I was there to supervise a cover session for British GQ, and having got Elton to agree to the shoot, along with an interview, I wanted to make sure everything ran smoothly. Plus, of course, I was desperate to see their house. Now, to say that the house was exquisite would be an understatement, although what I really loved was being shown Elton’s wardrobe.  And along with the corridors of suits, the lines of shirts, the acres of shoes, and    frankly    the stationary pantechnicons of stage jewelry, what fascinated me most were the drawers and drawers of spectacles.  An ’extraordinary’ collection of eyewear, Call them glasses, call them eyewear, call them what you will, but even then    having already divested himself of hundreds of pairs in various sales    Elton had a lot of them.  Spectacles he used for stagewear, for streetwear, and for wearing in makeshift photographic studies when being shot by illustrious Conde Nast men’s magazines. .. In fact, having spent a good half an hour sifting through Elton’s extraordinary collection, a collection made up of everything from vintage pieces to Art Deco gems, via punk and glam right up to the modern day    I realized that the history of eyeglasses could be told through Elton’s career.  To analyze his visual appeal is to look at a cavalcade of glasses which have been as important to his success as conical bras, say, were to Madonna’s.  If you think of David Bowie, you think of Ziggy Stardust’s red mullet if you think of Elvis you think of his white rhinestone jumpsuit. And if you think of Elton you no doubt think of one of the many pairs of outrageous glasses he has worn since he became famous. Evolution of spectacles  You can see glasses that Elton John might have worn in the current exhibition at the Design Museum Holon in Israel.  The exhibition follows the development of eyeglasses from several different points of view: from the unique Claude Samuel Collection dating right back to the 17th century, to contemporary conceptual interpretations of eyeglasses by fifty Israeli designers highlighting the creative energy of the Israeli design scene. There is also a bit of virtual reality to bring things up to date. Unique pieces ranging from Elton John and John Lennon style eyeglasses to authentic Eskimo bone eyewear are shown alongside sketches of eyewear designs made by Claude’s father from the Pierre Cardin Fashion House. This show gives you a glimpse of what lies behind behind lens, so to speak. Read: Understanding Bowie through his art, Speaking as someone who has needed to wear glasses since the age of ten, I know how important eyewear is.  Not only does it act as a disguise, but it also has the innate ability to make you look smarter than you are, dumber than you are, or, if need be, to completely alter your personality.‎  Spectacles can make you look richer, they can make you look poorer, and in the case of Elton John, a man who has more experience in this area than anyone who has ever set foot in the eyewear section of a department store, can make you look like an international superstar. Overview, an exhibition that traces the design evolution of eyewear, is currently on show at Design Museum Holon until April 29, 2017."

31665,31687,50453,Turkey: Gunman identified in nightclub attack,CNN,Ian Lee,1/4/17,2017,1,,"Istanbul (CNN) Turkish authorities said Wednesday they have identified the gunman who killed 39 people in the New Year’s nightclub terror attack in Istanbul. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Çavusoglu announced the development but did not name the suspect or provide his nationality. Authorities have also detained 20 alleged members of ISIS in connection with Sunday morning’s attack at the Reina nightclub,   news agency Anadolu reported Wednesday.  Counterterrorism officers arrested the suspected militants at four addresses in the Bornova and Buca districts of the Aegean province of Izmir, according to Anadolu. Eleven women were among those arrested. Anadolu said those detained are thought to have lived with the attacker in the central Anatolian city of Konya. Anadolu also reported that an array of military hardware was discovered during the raids, including   equipment, a sniper scope, an ammunition belt and other items. Twenty children found at the addresses were taken into temporary care. Altogether, at least 36 people are being held in connection with the nightclub shooting, though the gunman who carried it out remains at large. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement posted to Twitter, but CNN cannot independently verify it. The terror group boasted of carrying out the first major terrorist attack of 2017. Suspect seen in selfie video, On Monday, police released a video that the suspected gunman apparently took of himself in a market near the nightclub.  The ”selfie video” featuring the man in Istanbul’s Taksim Square was first posted on a   Telegram account before Turkish media broadcast it, said Laith Alkhouri, a director at Flashpoint, an American business risk intelligence company tracking terrorist and cyber threats.  Alkhouri told CNN that such a release suggests the attacker was part of a network supportive of or linked to ISIS, and that he had shared the selfie footage with the terror group before or after the attack. Growing threats, On Tuesday, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu told lawmakers that Turkish security forces had prevented 339 major terror incidents in 2016    80 of which came in the final three months of the year. In his speech to parliament, Soylu cited attacks launched by the militant Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, as well as those by Daesh, the Arabic term for ISIS. Anadolu quoted Soylu as saying that ”313 of the incidents were planned by PKK, 22 by Daesh and four by radical leftist groups.” He said that 247 improvised explosives and 61 bomb vehicles had been seized in 12 months. He also revealed the capture of 23 suicide bomber suspects as well as 42 terrorist group members who were preparing for attacks. Both ISIS and Kurdish militants have launched attacks in Turkey, which is reeling from a failed military coup in July. On Wednesday, Anadolu reported that authorities arrested four people, including a woman, in connection with a December 17 car bombing that killed 13 soldiers and wounded dozens in the central city of Kayseri. Victims from 14 countries, At least 11 victims in this week’s attack on the upscale nightclub were from Turkey, according to Anadolu, while at least 27 victims hailed from 13 other countries, including Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Canada. Dozens of people were hospitalized. A handful of the injured were in critical condition. Witnesses described how the New Year’s Eve celebration turned into a bloodbath. ”We were having fun. At first we thought it was a fight, then there was a lot of gunfire,” Yunus Turk told CNN. ”After the gunfire, everyone started to run toward the terrace. We ran as well. There was someone next to me who was shot and fell on the floor. We ran away and hid under the sofas.”"
31666,31688,50454,New UN secretary-general starts work,CNN,,1/3/17,2017,1,,"United Nations (CNN) Antonio Guterres cheerfully walked into the United Nations on Tuesday to officially assume his position as  . But looming large over his future is a man not far away, at Trump Tower in Manhattan, who also starts his new job soon.     Donald Trump has criticized the UN for its failure to perform and for a Security Council vote against Israel on settlements. He even tweeted that the UN was just a place ”to talk and have a good time.” When asked if Trump’s criticism worried him, Guterres responded, ”No. I am concerned about all the terrible problems we face in the world, all the wars that are happening everywhere.” He added, ”I hope we will all be able to come together.” Trump did say the UN has ”such great potential.”  Guterres, in a Snapchat interview Tuesday, took note of that remark. ”That’s exactly what I feel. My job is to make sure that potential becomes a reality,” he said. ”The US is a country totally committed to UN reforms and will be an important ally in the work ahead that needs to be done.” The United States is by far the largest funder of the 193 member countries of the UN, providing more than 20% of the UN budget. Any   has to make sure relations are good with the White House.   This is only the second time a UN   and a US president will begin their terms within weeks of each other.

The   noted there’s a lot of resentment and skepticism about the UN’s role. He told staff members to be proud of their achievements but added that ”we should recognize our shortcomings and failures.” Guterres appears to be more    than his predecessor, Ban   of South Korea, and more relaxed. Guterres, for example, spoke without notes to the UN staff. Guterres concluded by telling the staff, ”It’s not enough to do the right thing. We need to earn the right to do the right thing.”  "
31667,31689,50455,DHS chief: Don’t use ’Dreamer’ info to deport them,CNN,Evan Perez,1/3/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN) Department of Homeland Secretary Jeh Johnson is warning lawmakers that personal information collected by his agency for applications for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival, or   Dreamers, should not be used in the future to deport them.   Johnson’s veiled warning to incoming President Donald Trump and his administration could be useful in upcoming court cases if Trump revokes an executive order signed by President Barack Obama. That order, signed in 2012, stops deporting young undocumented immigrants who entered the United States as children so long as they meet certain requirements. ”Since DACA began, thousands of Dreamers have been able to enroll in colleges and universities, complete their education, start businesses that help improve our economy, and give back to our communities as teachers, medical professionals, engineers, and entrepreneurs    all on the books,” Johnson wrote in a letter. ”We continue to benefit as a country from the contributions of those young people who have come forward and want nothing more than to contribute to our country and our shared future.” Johnson said it is department precedent to only use the details of people seeking protection from deportation only for that express purpose, citing how foreign victims of Hurricane Katrina or abused immigrants under the jurisdiction of the Violence Against Women Act were treated.  ”We believe these representations made by the US government, upon which DACA applicants most assuredly relied, must continue to be honored,” Johnson wrote. Politico first reported Johnson’s letter. On the US Citizenship and Immigration Services website, the site states, ”Information provided in this request is protected from disclosure,” but also warns that policy ”may be modified.” ”This policy, which may be modified, superseded, or rescinded at any time without notice, is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by law by any party in any administrative, civil, or criminal matter,” the site states in its Frequently Asked Question’s page. Some immigration attorneys are advising their clients not to apply for DACA given the risks. Dreamers and several   mayors have asked Trump to reconsider his plan to scrap the protections. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel pressed Trump over the issue at a meeting in Trump Tower last month. Trump in recent weeks appeared to soften his tone about Dreamers, telling Time magazine: ”We’re going to work something out that’s going to make people happy and proud.”"

31669,31691,50457,Obama tells Democrats: ’Don’t rescue’ Republicans on ’Trumpcare’,CNN,MJ Lee,1/4/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN) President Barack Obama delivered a mandate to Democrats on Wednesday: ”Don’t rescue” Republicans on Obamacare. Less than three weeks out from leaving the White House, Obama visited Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill with a mission to save his signature healthcare reform law as Republicans are moving quickly to unroll the Affordable Care Act. In the   meeting, the President urged fellow Democrats to not ”rescue” Republicans by helping them pass replacement measures, according to sources in the room.  He also floated this idea: Start referring to the GOP’s new plan as ”Trumpcare.”  The suggestion was a clear indication of the Democratic Party’s goal of turning the tables on Republicans, who are already facing pressure to quickly craft a replacement bill.  As he walked by a scrum of reporters, Obama would only say this about the Democratic Party’s message: ”Look out for the American people.” After the meeting, a White House aide said Obama used ”Trumpcare” as an indication he was open to Trump taking credit for improvements.  The feisty remarks from the outgoing President came as Republicans also huddled on Capitol Hill Wednesday morning to chart their path forward repealing Obamacare. Vice   Mike Pence visited with GOP lawmakers in what became a morning of dueling meetings on Day Two of the new Congress. Pence told reporters following the meeting: ”Make no mistake about it: We’re going to keep our promise to the American people    we’re going to repeal Obamacare and replace it with solutions that lower the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government.” The public theater of the simultaneous meetings Wednesday was the clearest indication in the new year that Obamacare will be an   and deeply contentious political fight under the next president, Donald Trump. With Republicans about to control the House, Senate and the White House, Democrats are strategizing on ways to pressure the GOP against rolling back the law    and ensuring the Republicans are held responsible for any disruptions in health coverage. (Following their meeting, Democratic lawmakers started to push the phrase: ”Make America Sick Again”    a play on Trump’s campaign slogan, ”Make America Great Again. ”) Republicans, meanwhile, have the massive task of figuring out how to replace what they repeal. Republican members leaving the meeting with Pence said the gathering felt like a ”pep rally” but that there were not many policy details discussed. According to GOP Rep. Chris Collins, the party is eyeing the goal of crafting a replacement proposal in six months. Pence, who was a congressman before serving as Indiana’s governor, recalled his time in the House and accused Democrats of breaking the promises made at the time.  ”The reality is that I was here in March of 2010 in another capacity when Obamacare was signed into law,” Pence said alongside other GOP leaders including House Speaker Paul Ryan. ”I remember all those promises. We were told that if you like your doctor, you can keep it. Not true.” Both Ryan and Pence promised a ”careful” replacement of the law, trying to assuage concerns that a straight repeal of Obamacare would leave many including those with   conditions without healthcare.  The benefits of Obamacare was something the President emphasized in his meeting with Democrats, according to Rep. Maxine Waters, and argued that the country largely likes the law and that he has received countless letters thanking him for Obamacare. Another lawmaker in the room said the mood among Democrats was ”fired up.”  ”In two weeks I will no longer be a politician, but I’ll still be a citizen. I envy you so much right now, because I would love to be on the field,” Obama said, according to the member. Too partisan? Some lawmakers on Tuesday questioned the wisdom of planning clashing meetings, each designed to advance a partisan agenda. ”Any type of a meeting that we have that’s not bipartisan is not in the proper scheme of things of starting out the new year,” said Sen. Joe Manchin, the moderate Democrat from West Virginia, who said he would skip the Obama meeting. ”It’s just not a good situation for us to be in. So if Mr. Pence is coming up here only to speak to Republicans and President Obama’s coming here only to speak to Democrats, I would be concerned about that. Because I don’t know how you change anything    how do you change anything unless we all come together?” Republicans have long vowed to get rid of Obamacare, voting on dozens of measures that would repeal the law. Those attempts were largely theatre there was never a scenario in which Obama himself would approve the repeal of his own landmark legislative accomplishment.  Trump made getting rid of the law a key element of his campaign strategy. He said on Twitter Tuesday that Obamacare provided ”lousy healthcare.” With Trump headed for the Oval Office, and Republicans controlling both houses of Congress, the prospects for a successful repeal now appear more realistic. On Tuesday, Senate Republicans took their first steps toward repealing Obamacare, filing a budget resolution reversing key elements of the law. There remain divisions, however, on which precise elements of the law to scrap, and how to replace Obamacare with a law that doesn’t strip Americans of their health insurance. Sen. Rand Paul,   wrote in an   Tuesday that lawmakers shouldn’t vote on repealing Obamacare until a replacement plan was developed. ”If Congress fails to vote on a replacement at the same time as repeal, the repealers risk assuming the blame for the continued unraveling of Obamacare. For mark my words, Obamacare will continue to unravel and wreak havoc for years to come,” he wrote.   And Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who’s been tapped to serve as his senior counselor at the White House, said Tuesday that passing repeal and replacement measures simultaneously would be ”the ideal situation.” ”We don’t want anyone who currently has insurance to not have insurance,” Conway said on MSNBC, adding there ”are some pieces of merit in the current plan.”"

31671,31693,50459,Republicans already jittery about Obamacare repeal,CNN,MJ Lee,1/4/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN) Republicans are just getting started on their   dream of repealing Obamacare, and already, there are fears that things are moving too fast. Some Republicans are cautioning against repealing the Affordable Care Act too quickly and urging the party take the foot off the accelerator. The reason: there’s no plan on how to replace what they roll back. And while GOP lawmakers are eager to please their base with headlines of Obamacare’s repeal, they don’t want to be blamed for leaving people without health insurance and chaos in the healthcare market. Sen. John McCain told reporters Tuesday that he supports taking a slower approach to repealing the law, saying he is ”always worried about something that took a long time in the making and we’ve got to concentrate our efforts to making sure that we do it right so that nobody’s left out.” Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House Speaker and a close ally of   Donald Trump, told CNN that a big risk for Republicans is getting blamed for taking away people’s health coverage. Nightcap: Congress returns  —   with a House GOP stumble | Sign up, ”Number one thing (Republicans) have to avoid is putting themselves in a position where Democrats can frighten people    that somehow, they won’t have access to health care because of Republicans,” Gingrich said.   Gingrich stressed that before Republicans send a bill repealing Obamacare to Trump’s desk, the party must make real progress on a replacement plan. ”They have to have bridges to give people a sense of comfort that they’re not going to be abandoned,” he said.   GOP Sen. Rand Paul cited potential insurance market problems if the law isn’t replaced when it is repealed. ”If Congress fails to vote on a replacement at the same time as repeal, the repealers risk assuming the blame for the continued unraveling of Obamacare,” he said in an   Tuesday. ”For mark my words, Obamacare will continue to unravel and wreak havoc for years to come.”  These initial hints of anxiety from Republicans foreshadow an internal GOP    on Obamacare in the coming weeks. For now, party leaders are leaning towards a repeal bill that includes a   or   transition period that would offer a buffer    a strategy that has been dubbed ”repeal and delay.” House and Senate Republicans both started procedural efforts Tuesday    the first day of the new session of Congress    that will lead to overhauling Obamacare.   But healthcare experts warn that even if the repeal doesn’t go into effect right away, the uncertainty could lead to insurance companies fleeing the marketplace and potentially putting millions of people’s coverage at risk.    In a clear effort to counter some of the early criticism, leaders of the conservative House Republican Study Committee plan to unveil legislation on Wednesday that they argue would both repeal and replace Obamacare.  The bill was previously introduced by GOP Rep. Phil Roe, a physician, and has not been endorsed by leadership. While it is unlikely to emerge as the main Obamacare repeal bill in the House, it marks an effort by conservatives to push back on the suggestion that the party has no replacement plan.   Democrats turn the tables, All of this comes as Democrats are pouncing on the opportunity to turn the tables on Republicans. Lawmakers are planning a PR blitz throughout the month of January, accusing Republicans for possibly putting millions of Americans’ health coverage in jeopardy. Sen. Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat from West Virginia, warned that repeal and delay approach would result in a ”chaotic” scene.  ”I’m just going to caution again, my friends: Don’t repeal this unless there’s a bipartisan group,” Manchin said. ”And if you don’t have anything to replace it with, don’t put repeal on the board.”  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said on a call Monday that the GOP’s ”repeal and delay” strategy amounts to ”an act of cowardice,” and warned that Democrats will play no role in helping their colleagues across the aisle replace the ACA.   ”It’s the old thing of going into a china shop    you break it, you own it,” Pelosi said.  Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein told CNN on Tuesday that she is in the process of crafting   on Obamacare, along the lines of: ”Look at what this is going to do to people.”  ”That’s the important thing,” she said. ”How many people are going to lose their healthcare?”"
31672,31694,50460,Bangalore police chief: ’Not a single lady was molested’,CNN,Juliet Perry,1/4/17,2017,1,," (CNN) A newspaper report that a mob of men molested women on the streets of an Indian city on New Year’s Eve sparked controversy and concern after a government official confirmed it, but the police denied that any such thing happened. It started with a report in the The Bangalore Mirror, the paper saying that its photojournalists witnessed ”a brazen mass molestation of women” in the city’s central business district. The news story was picked up by other media outlets across India. Eyewitness Parikshit Murria told CNN that he saw ”a horde of men” molesting girls ”in every possible manner.”  And a state minister confirmed that females were ”harassed” in the city during the New Year celebrations    although he added fuel to the fire by apparently suggesting the women were to blame. Meanwhile, the allegations were firmly denied by a police chief in Bangalore, who suggested that they were concocted by journalists. ”The media is making it look like molestation was happening by blurring the faces [of people in pictures] but no such thing was happening,” said Praveen Sood, Bangalore’s commissioner of police. However, Sood admitted there were chaotic scenes in the central business district during the    celebrations, and ”panic in the crowd.” According to the Bangalore Mirror, ”a mob” of ”unruly men” engaged in a ”brazen mass molestation of women” as tens of thousands of revelers gathered on December 31.  The publication said the incident was witnessed by its photojournalists.  ”All hell broke loose close to midnight as hooligans in the garb of revelers started pawing, molesting and passing lewd remarks on women on the streets, forcing some of them to literally take off their stilettos and run for help,” it reported. On Wednesday, The Bangalore Mirror said it stood by its story. ”We have spoken to two victims who were molested and nine people who were witnesses and confirmed what they saw,” editor Ravi Joshi told CNN. ”I don’t know what the police mean [when they say no one was molested]. We don’t know why they’re not believing the reports,” he said. ’Shocked’   software engineer Parikshit Murria told CNN he was horrified by the scene unfolding before him around 11. 30 p. m. while he was out with two friends. Murria said they saw a ”horde of people walking very fast.” They assumed there might be a ”VIP or celeb” in the group he said, but soon realized there were two girls at the center of the mob. The men were ”trying to molest them in every possible manner,” Murria said. ”We just got few glimpses of those girls and one of them was on ground. I don’t know what happened to them after that, we were pushed further away by the crowd. We never expected this kind of atmosphere and we were completely shocked.” Murria claimed that minutes later, he and his friends saw a man trying to touch one of a group of four women who were ”without any male accompany.” Murria said they scared the man off and accompanied the group to a taxi. ”I was in the front and two of my friends on the back, and those girls were in between,” Murria told CNN. ”I don’t even remember how many hands and people I threw away.” Some men became aggressive with him and his friends. ”A few came to fight with us and few just went away after looking into my eyes. Finally, we dropped them near their cab.” Murria reported seeing numerous girls in tears, some being guarded by the police. ”At some places there were shoes and slippers all over the road, like some stampede has just happened.” ’One of them groped me’ Chaitali Wasnik, a    photographer, told CNN that she was groped at a street party in the Indira Nagar area of Bangalore at around 1. 30 am on New Year’s Day. This is a different location to the other reports, described by Wasnik as ”a pub hub and a posh part of Bangalore.” ”The area was brightly lit and there were thousands of people there partying on the same street. I had a friend with me, but he was a little drunk so I was trying to get a cab for him. Then two men approached me from the front. I moved aside. But one of them groped me,” she said. ”I was wearing a jumpsuit, he slid his hand inside and groped my breast. I panicked, and when I came to my senses, I started to hit and scratch him. He too panicked and started telling people surrounding us that he didn’t do anything. People around me pulled me back, saying ’leave it, it happens.’ That guy and his friend escaped.” Wasnik added: ”The guy appeared to be   years old. There were lots of policemen in the area but no one available around me when the incident happened. I cannot complain to the police because the guy ran away. I assumed they won’t be able to do anything because I have no identification. I couldn’t do anything so I just searched for a cab and went home.” ’They try to copy westerners’ G Parameshwara, home minister of Karnakata state, confirmed that assaults happened    despite what the police told CNN. However, he seemed to place blame on the alleged victims. ”They try to copy the westerners, not only in their mindset but even in the dressing,” he said in an interview with local press. ”So some disturbance, some girls are harassed, these kinds of things do happen.” Responding to the minister’s comments, Himel Sakar, a representative for the   women’s rights NGO, Breakthrough, told CNN: ”There’s a simmering sentiment among a lot of people that because women were out there celebrating New Year they were asking to be assaulted. ”It’s now that we must lead the charge for a reoccupation of our public spaces.” Parameshwara told local media that additional police and surveillance had been deployed to control and monitor the crowds, and they had footage of assaults taking place. ”We will see who has done all these kinds of things and we’ll see what best we can do,” he said. But this was contradicted by senior police officers who spoke to CNN. Praveen Sood, Bangalore’s commissioner of police said: ”This [mass molestation] did not occur. Not a single lady was molested. We have the complete unedited video footage [from CCTV cameras] and are going to release it.” He alleged that pictures with blurred faces made it look like molestation was happening when it was not.  Sood added: ”There were tens of thousands of people gathered at MG Road and Brigade Road on New Year’s Eve. This happens every year, has been happening for the last 25 years. There were 1, 500 police personnel present to manage the crowd.” However, he admitted that people tried to break barricades amid chaotic scenes and panic in the crowd. Meanwhile K. V. Sharath Chandra, an additional commissioner of police in Bangalore, told CNN: ”We are waiting for a victim to come forward and file a complaint with the police. .. but no one has come to police yet. If someone registered a case, that would be fantastic.” Sexual assault frequently goes unreported in India because victims feel they will not be taken seriously or kept safe."
31673,31696,50462,Arrests end NAACP sit-in at Jeff Sessions’ office,CNN,,1/3/17,2017,1,," (CNN) An NAACP   to protest the nomination of US Sen. Jeff Sessions as US attorney general ended late Tuesday when six people were arrested at Sessions’ Mobile, Alabama, office. The arrests of five men and one woman included NAACP President Cornell W. Brooks, said Malik Russell, director of communications for the civil rights group. They face charges of criminal trespass in the   according to Mobile police. The protesters arrived earlier Tuesday and said they would stay until Sessions is no longer the nominee or they were arrested. ”We are asking the senator to withdraw his name for consideration as attorney general or for the   Donald Trump, to withdraw the nomination,” Brooks said Tuesday afternoon from Sessions’ office. ”In the midst of rampant voter suppression, this nominee has failed to acknowledge the reality of voter suppression while pretending to believe in the myth of voter fraud.”  Earlier in the day, Alabama NAACP President Benard Simelton said he and   others were there ”conducting business as usual” and would remain until ”Sessions meets our demands or the arrest    whichever he chooses.” Sessions was nominated in November. Brooks posted a photo on Twitter of himself, Simelton and two other activists in the office. Sessions, a former Alabama attorney general, has been a controversial figure in the past. His appointment to a federal district court in 1986 by   Ronald Reagan sank when a former Justice Department employee testified that Sessions had made racist remarks. Sessions denied the allegations. Sessions spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores, in a statement to CNN, said the senator ”has dedicated his career to upholding the rule of law, ensuring public safety and prosecuting government corruption.” ”Many   leaders who’ve known him for decades attest to this and have welcomed his nomination to be the next attorney general. These false portrayals of Sen. Sessions will fail as tired, recycled, hyperbolic charges that have been thoroughly rebuked and discredited,” she said."
31674,31697,50463,Preparing for the worst: How to escape Kim Jong Un,CNN,Juliet Perry,1/3/17,2017,1,,"Seoul (CNN) It’s a bitterly cold, bleak day on a military base in South Korea. People are milling around calmly, clutching hot coffees, making small talk. Kids are chasing each other around an air hangar.  It’s hard to believe they are practicing a   emergency evacuation that simulates what would happen if North Korea invaded.  ”In real life, everyone would be wearing masks, rushing through places,” says mom of two Nicholle Martinez. ”There would be chaos everywhere. It would be scarier.”  Nicholle met Nick Martinez when they were both stationed with the US military in Seoul. They’ve now been married for nine years and have two beautiful, energetic and charismatic children. Briannah, 6, is in first grade, and Alannah, 8, is in third.  In many respects they’re very typical. They go to church on Sundays and have lunch together afterward. They like to play sports    mom and dad want the girls to grow into healthy, strong young ladies.  Briannah wants to be a teacher, Alannah wants to be president. But, because the whole family is now living on post in Seoul, the Martinez family lives with the   danger of a very noisy and unpredictable neighbor    Kim Jong Un. In the face of escalating tension, the Martinez women are practicing their path to safety. In a   exercise, they traveled by bus, helicopter and military plane from South Korea all the way to the Pacific island of Okinawa, Japan.  In a CNN exclusive, we went along with them for the ride. All those taking part in the drill are volunteers    relations of US soldiers stationed in Seoul. Unlike in a real scenario, they’ve had the opportunity to plan a little for this event.  There are a number of reasons why an order like this could be enacted, says Justin Sturn, a   evacuation planner. He uses the 2011 earthquake in Japan or the recent evacuation of   from Turkey as examples.  However, for all the claims this is a routine practice run, Kim’s threats loom over the exercise. In September, North Korea said it had hit the button on its fifth and potentially most powerful nuclear test. International condemnation and aggressive sanctions have done little to impede the regime’s nuclear ambitions.  In a New Year’s address, Kim said that his country is close to testing an intercontinental ballistic missile.  ”He’s said publicly that we’re the enemy,” says Sturn.  ”With all the rhetoric that comes out of North Korea, of course we have to prepare for the worst case scenario.” Military families stationed in South Korea are encouraged to have a bag ready to go at all times. ”I have a duffel bag that is always packed with sleeping bags and canned food,” says Nicholle. According to Sturn, the decision to get soldiers’ families out of the country would come right from the top.  A   evacuation order (NEO) is a political decision, not a military one. ”We would conduct the mission, but the execution is still a Department of State decision,” says Sturn. The Army is trying to make the environment as realistic as possible.  Family members are permitted to bring along 60 pounds of personal stuff each. Military representatives urge the group to only bring the bare essentials. I ask the Martinez family what went into their bags first. ”My cellphone!” says Nicholle in a heartbeat.  ”My blanket,” says   old Alannah. She wraps her comfort around herself like a cape. Briannah pauses, shyly. Mom and sister exclaim they know exactly what went into her rucksack first. The    takes a moment to rummage in her bag and produces her   item with a flourish    a military issue doll given to the girls when Nick went on his first tour.  ”Daddy doll!” The girls are carrying their   items, but one lesson Nicholle says she’s already learned from the exercise is to pack a little lighter. Although she’s a strong fitness instructor, she’s weighed down with over 150 pounds of luggage and it’s slowing her down.  A string of tents is pitched at Yongsan Garrison military base. There’s an icy wind and a trace of nervous anticipation in the air as families slowly gather.  This is the first time since 2010 the evacuation simulation has gone all the way to Okinawa. Most people aren’t really sure what to expect    they’ve just been told, ”it’s not going to be comfortable.” The group are issued with identity bracelets that will track their progress from South Korea to Okinawa. If this were a genuine evacuation, the families would then be flown back to the United States from Japan.  There is a security screening and the opportunity to register any pets traveling. The Martinez family joke that the fish didn’t make the cut. One stage of the registration process also includes instructions on the ICAPS mask    or Infant Chemical Agent Protective System    that protects against the effects of biological attacks for up to 12 hours.  There’s a lot of nervous laughter and ”Ghostbusters” references abound. Briannah gets into the spirit of things.  But for all the smiles and calm instruction, the vision of a 6   preparing for a chemical or biological attack isn’t a comfortable one. Nicholle, who herself was in the military police, says that as well as being a great life experience, it’s a good opportunity for the girls to get some insight into what dad does for a living. ”They only have five more years until dad retires,” she says. ”So being here has opened their eyes as to what military life is.”  Alannah is already showing signs of logistical aptitude. She tells me she’s not sure why they’d take so many steps to evacuate the country, if it really was an emergency. I suggest it might seem easier just to get families onto a commercial flight in Seoul.  ”That’s what I would do!” she says. ”Just get outta there.”  I put Alannah’s question to Sturn, who says the movement south would be in response to hostile maneuverings from the north and the ”need to move people out of that hotspot.” ”If it was a natural disaster, or something like that, we would absolutely fly them out of Seoul,” says Sturn. ”But this is the   scenario. And the   scenario is North Korea is coming across the border, and we need to get people out of harm’s way.” After about an hour’s drive in convoy from the registration point in Seoul, we arrive at Camp Humphreys, further south in Pyeongtaek. We’re taken through a hangar full of military hardware towards two US Army   or Chinook helicopters, sitting on the tarmac.  We’re given a safety orientation, issued earplugs and escorted on to the machine.  This is the first time most of the civilians have flown in a military helicopter. The roar, heat and pure force from the blades is overwhelming as we get on board.  If they had to evacuate by helicopter, this is a fair enactment of how it would go, says Col. Lance Calvert, commander of the 2nd Combat Aviation Brigade. However, with the increased numbers a   scenario would entail, he says there would be more practical ways to transport people out of Pyeongtaek. It’s estimated that    if this were a genuine evacuation of   from South Korea    the order could be for tens of thousands of civilians to leave over a period of five to seven days. ”Trains, buses or commercial transportation systems are much more efficient,” he says.  The aim of the drill isn’t only to try to give relatives a realistic practice run. The military also considers the ”mental aptitude” of a soldier in a crisis and believes exercising this process builds confidence. It shows acting service members that, in a dangerous situation, their family members would be cared for.  ”In a natural disaster or hostile scenario, the last thing you want is your soldier thinking about his family,’” says Capt. Jimmy Sheehan. The helicopters land in Daegu. After a mess dinner, we spend a chilly night in the dormitories on the US military base, Camp Walker. The next morning, we’re up at 5 a. m.  Despite the intensity and length of the journey so far, all the kids in the group are still in good spirits. A trip to Okinawa aquarium is nearly within grasp.  A convoy through the spectacular mountainous south takes us to Gimhae Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) base where we’re escorted on to a US Air Force   Hercules transport plane for the drill’s final leg    onwards to Japan.  The Hercules is an impressive beast, and the ” ” run into it in anticipation of arriving in warmer southern climes.  Earplugs at the ready, we’re strapped in. Most of the children curl up and nod off    an oddly peaceful scene in such a stark environment.  Landing in Japan is the highlight for the Martinez girls, who tell me with great enthusiasm how much they like exploring new places.   ”For some reason, I thought we were going to go on a secret subway tunnel!” says Alannah. Her younger sister interjects wistfully: ”I wish we could go through a tunnel to a magical place.”  ”Just close your eyes and imagine it,” laughs mom.  She says they seize these kinds of opportunities because, as a military family that’s often on the move, they try to make the best of it everywhere they go.  ”You adapt and you will succeed, or you will be miserable if you don’t,” she says. ”We embrace these kinds of events because we help our spouses. My husband benefits from us enjoying our time here. If we’re happy, he’s happy.” For Nicholle, the experience has also made her reflect on how an emergency evacuation would really feel. The idea of leaving all the material things behind isn’t difficult. ”The most important thing is that I get my girls to a safe place,”’ she says.  But it has driven home what, for her, would be the most painful part of the process. ”Knowing that I would be leaving my husband behind. .. that would be the hardest thing.”"
31675,31698,50464,Africa’s new biofuel literally grows on trees,CNN,,12/28/16,2016,12,," (CNN) The history of biofuel production in Africa is marked with expensive and damaging failures.  The   jatropha crop saw millions of dollars and vast tracts of land squandered, while the production of palm oil has been widely criticized for association with environmental damage and human rights abuses.  But there is a new hope for the field. The Croton megalocarpus tree is common throughout much of East and Central Africa, and until now it has been used for little more than firewood.   The nuts of the tree have been shown to contain high concentrations of oil and protein, and they are now being used to produce a fuel that could serve as a clean alternative to diesel.  With an abundant supply of croton nuts available at minimal cost, a new industry is emerging with   ambitions.    fruit, In 2012, serial entrepreneur Alan Paul established Eco Fuels Kenya (EFK) to explore the potential of croton, following early research that suggested promise. His company is now the driving the movement to bring croton biofuel to the mainstream.   The business took a   approach at first, in contrast to   flops such as jatropha.   ”(Paul) said we can grow organically by sourcing what is already there from one of the most common trees,” says EFK Managing Director Myles Katz. ”We can buy nuts from farmers so they get an income and we have a business model that does not require $10 million of funding and a big plantation to get off the ground.” EFK put out radio ads to attract local entrepreneurs into partnerships, who assembled teams of smallholders to supply the nuts. When suppliers realized their previously useless trees had become an easy and reliable source of income, the network rapidly expanded.   This has enabled EFK to double production each year, says Katz, up to 1, 000 tons of nuts this year from 500 tons in 2015. The company is now in a position to scale up the operation, without having planted a single tree.  New products, Producing croton nut oil is a     process compared with traditional fuel manufacturing.  ”It is comparable to any other nut or oil pressing facility,” says Katz. ”We modify the equipment to work on croton nuts but essentially we are buying machines used with walnuts or macadamia nuts.” Much of the fuel is sold to local businesses that run generators, such as tourist camps. The company has also branched into selling   of the nuts, including seedcake from the pressed nut as poultry feed, and organic fertilizer from the shells. This offers insurance at a time investors remain wary of biofuels, says Katz.  ”The ’unknown’ (element) is hard for investors,” he says. ”We are not an   business, and we can stand on different parts of the business at different times.” Grand plans, local roots  Having local networks of suppliers and agents is key to the EFK business model, and a critical challenge for the company is to maintain these networks while expanding across the country and beyond.  ”We have a completely local approach,” says Katz. ”Everything we source, process and sell should be within 100 kilometers of the factory.” The company plans to maintain this approach while creating up to five new factories in Kenya and several more in neighboring countries such as Tanzania in the coming years.  EFK is also planning a first foray into an ”orchard model” of planting its own trees on a   plot in 2017, that will allow the company to test and push the limits of croton capacity.  ”There is an interesting topic of crop efficiency,” says Katz. ”An indigenous tree with access to normal rainfall might produce 100 kilograms of nuts a year. But the optimum trees will produce over 300 kilograms. ..The ’orchard model’ can change outcomes dramatically.”  Ripe for success, Croton can succeed where other biofuels have failed, according to Dr. Gerald Kafuku, principal research officer of the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology, who has published several papers on the properties of croton oil.  ”I can say that croton is one of the most promising sources of biofuel,” he says. ”It can give advantages in the form of biodiesel or straight oil, and as a ’carbon sink’ for afforestation.”   Kafuku believes that only a lack of funding for research and development is holding croton back from the mainstream. He adds that the region urgently needs such solutions.  ”East Africa is among the areas where there is significant environmental degradation,” he says. ”New biofuels such as croton can add to the alternative sources of renewable energy as well as providing for more planting of trees.” Croton can also avoid the ethical pitfalls of other biofuels by benefiting local communities, according to Rodrigo Ciannella, head of the biofuels program at the World Agroforestry Centre.  ”(Croton) is providing value from a natural resource that is already abundant in the country and is largely wasted,” he says. ”Farmers are already benefiting from receiving additional income. ..and they could get even more by having access to other components of the value chain such as fertilizer.” With global demand for biofuels set to increase steadily, Katz believes it is a matter of time before oil giants enter the croton market and the nut becomes a major industry that can rival fossil fuels.  ”I like to tell people that croton will be a coffee or tea type of value chain,” he says. ”There will be lots of competitors and regional processing all over East Africa.” "
31676,31699,50465,Will black college band perform at Trump inauguration?,CNN,,1/4/17,2017,1,,"Talladega, Alabama (CNN) The president of a historically black college in Alabama has yet to decide whether the school’s marching band will perform at   Donald Trump’s inaugural parade, a college spokeswoman said Wednesday. The Talladega College Marching Tornadoes band was among 40 organizations that accepted an invitation to take part in the inaugural parade after the January 20 swearing in, according to an initial list released Friday by Trump’s inaugural committee.  The possibility that the band from the    college, founded by former slaves in the small town of Talladega, could perform sparked controversy    and resulted in two dueling petitions. College President Billy C. Hawkins has the petitions    one organized by a current student in favor of performing and the other by a Talladega graduate against taking part    CNN affiliate WVTM reported. Hawkins was expected to announce his decision Wednesday, school spokesman Greg Wilson told CNN. But another school official, spokeswoman Veronica   told CNN late Wednesday that any decision was unlikely to be announced during the evening.   said Hawkins had been meeting with board members all day, but no decision had been reached. Hawkins was scheduled to appear Wednesday on ”CNN Tonight” with Don Lemon, but canceled the appearance.  Appearance of supporting Trump, A petition started by Shirley Ferrill, a 1974 graduate, calls on the band to ”withdraw from any inaugural events for Donald Trump.”  ”In view of his behavior and comments I strongly do not want Talladega College to give the appearance of supporting him,” she wrote. The petition had more than 900 supporters by Tuesday night.  Trump has made what many view as disparaging comments about people of color, including saying that Mexico was sending its worst citizens over the border.  ”Some are good and some are rapists and some are killers. We don’t even know what we’re getting,” he said in 2015. Trump has also used the word ”ghettos” referring to the inner cities when he described issues faced by   in the starkest terms. ”The violence. The death. The lack of education. No jobs. We’re going to work with the   community and we’re going to solve the problem of the inner city,” he said in 2016. ”We’re going to bring safety back. You can’t walk out on the street, you buy a loaf of bread and you end up getting shot.” About ’the experience’ students will get, In the second petition, Talladega student and band member Dollan Young wrote: ”We believe that this parade is not about politics it’s about seeing first hand the process of a transition.” Young wrote that taking part in the inaugural would not be in support of a political party, but rather ”about the experience that the students will obtain.”  His petition had garnered close to 200 signatures by Tuesday night.  Another band member, Shylexis Robinson, told CNN affiliate WVTM she was excited and felt the performance would ”put our school on the map.”  Robinson said it wasn’t ”about Donald Trump himself, it’s about our school. And I’m all about our school and all about the band.”  Performance wouldn’t ’uplift’ Talladega, Edna Garrett, of Talladega, told WVTM that being associated with Trump and negativity surrounding him wouldn’t benefit Talladega. ”I don’t really see how it would uplift the school in any way,” she said. Talladega College, founded in 1867, is Alabama’s oldest private historically black liberal arts college, according to the school’s website. It’s band, though, is relatively young. Wilson said the   band started in 2012 and recently performed in New Orleans at the halftime show for a National Football League game between the New Orleans Saints and the Denver Broncos. One artist invited to perform at Trump’s festivities has said she would do so    with one requirement. This week, Rebecca Ferguson, a former   on the British version of ”X Factor,” said on Twitter she had been invited and would take part if she could perform ”Strange Fruit.”  The song protested racism and addressed lynching in the South. It was made famous by the late Billie Holiday, a renowned jazz musician. In a statement posted to Ferguson’s Twitter account Monday night, she said the song ”has huge historical importance, a song that was blacklisted in the United States for being too controversial.  A song that speaks to all the disregarded and downtrodden black people in the United States. A song that is a reminder of how love is the only thing that will conquer all the hatred in this world, then I will graciously accept your invitation and see you in Washington. Best Rebecca X.” The lyrics, written in the 1930s by Jewish communist Abel Meeropol, were composed as a protest poem to highlight racism in America’s southern states. The song’s opening lyrics are: ”Southern trees bear strange fruit   Blood on the leaves and blood at the root   bodies swinging in the southern breeze   Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.” Controversy among announced performers, The inaugural committee has announced three acts so far: the Radio City Rockettes, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and    ”America’s Got Talent” star Jackie Evancho. But there still is controversy surrounding the group of committed performers. A member of the Mormon choir, which has performed at five presidential inaugurations, quit. Jan Chamberlin said the performance would betray her values. Last month, the Madison Square Garden Company said in a statement that individual Rockettes wouldn’t be compelled to participate at the inauguration after one dancer in the group, Phoebe Pearl, reportedly protested on Instagram.  Her post has since been deleted. In November Sir Elton John refused an invitation to perform at the inauguration    denying a claim made by the   of Trump’s presidential inaugural committee that the singer was slated to perform.  Trump has tweeted that he wants ”the PEOPLE” at his inauguration, rather than   celebrities.  Barack Obama’s 2009 inauguration featured artists such as Beyonce, Aretha Franklin, James Taylor, Brad Paisley and Alicia Keys."

Some, like American artists Jim Denevan and Sean Yoro, produce their works outdoors.  Denevan creates geometric patterns on surfaces across the world. In 2010, he traced   circles onto the frozen Lake Baikal in Siberia. Yoro, on other hand, used ice to send a message.  Yoro recently painted haunting images of faces directly onto melting ice floes in Iceland and Canada, to raise awareness about climate change. Others have used ice to show innovation.

China’s national observatory issued the fog alert Tuesday in a number of northern and eastern regions. That followed some 24 cities issuing red alerts for air pollution. Red is the most serious level in the country’s warning system. Through Wednesday, thick fog in parts of the    region will reduce visibility to less than 500 meters (about 547 yards) as well as in the provinces of Henan, Shandong, Anhui and Jiangsu, the National Meteorological Center said. In extreme cases, visibility may fall below 50 meters (55 meters) in those regions. The center also renewed an orange alert for smog in the same period in northern, eastern and central China, with smog continuing to blanket the regions since Friday. By Wednesday, the fog alert in Beijing had been downgraded to yellow, though the city issued a red alert for smog, according to the Beijing Meteorological Service."
31679,31704,50470,The hardest New Year’s resolution to keep,CNN,,1/4/17,2017,1,," (CNN) It’s that time of year when many of us take a cold, hard look at our lives    and, more important, our vices    to set a goal we believe will make us healthier or happier in the year ahead. There are 1 billion smokers worldwide, and one resolution in the top 10 each year is the intention to kick the habit for good. But this goal is the most difficult of all resolutions to keep, with three in five people in the United Kingdom who resolved to quit taking the habit up again by the end of January, according to new data released by the Royal Society of Public Health in the UK. Of more than 2, 000 people surveyed about their resolutions at the end of 2016 by research consultancy Populus, 175 (8%) had chosen to quit smoking, but only 41% of those 175 kept it going until January 31. Just 13% remained   at the end of the year. ”One of the main challenges of smoking is that it’s a chemical addiction,” said Duncan Stephenson, director of external affairs at the Royal Society of Public Health. Quitting ”takes huge amounts of willpower.” Stephenson was unsurprised by the findings. They’re an important reminder that people should not to give up after the first hurdle or  . They can use support services or quitting aids, such as nicotine replacement therapy or   to improve their chances of success, he said. ”Rather than setting unrealistic goals and making huge changes to lifestyle, we suggest people make small changes using a   approach,” he said. ”During the new year, lots of people want to reinvent themselves . .. but people shouldn’t set themselves up to fail.”  Stephenson likened quitting smoking to the challenge of going on a diet in which people set unrealistic targets by making dramatic    and often      changes. ”Christmas is one of the most calorific periods of the year, and then you put yourself in a straitjacket when you go on a crash diet,” he said. ”In most cases, 95% of diets fail.” In the organization’s survey, dieting was second from last in terms of resolution success, with 65% of people lasting one month and just 16% making it to the end of the year.  ”The most difficult resolutions to keep were the consumptive, addictive behaviors, such as smoking and dieting,” said John Norcross, distinguished professor of psychology at the University of Scranton and author of the behavior change book ”Changeology.” Norcross has been exploring resolutions and the factors impacting people’s ability to change for more almost 30 years. ”The easiest ones are the realistic, attainable resolutions that can be accomplished permanently in the first three or four weeks,” he said. Be realistic, The most successful resolutions in 2016 were among people who had chosen to improve relationships with friends and family, followed by shaping a healthier   balance. More than 80% of people who resolved to improve relationships reported doing so by the end of January, with 58% having stuck with it to the end of the year. A better   balance came in second, with 75% keeping this resolution for one month and 43% still feeling they were doing this at the end of the year. ”It’s not so much the topic, it’s how realistic the goal is,” Norcross said, adding that for the most successful resolution, ”it doesn’t say ’fix,’ it says ’improve’ . .. so they will have a much higher success rate.” The fact that people   their success inevitably brings some bias to the findings, in addition to the fact that people had to recall things from earlier in the year, said Norcross.  But also worth noting is the broadness of the data. ”We don’t know how people characterize their success rates. . .. We don’t have a sense of magnitude for improvement,” said Norcross, giving the example of playing sports and not knowing whether people played once a week or every few months.  For its next survey, Stephenson said, the Royal Society of Public Health will be asking participants for more detail and will inquire further about what threw people off their resolutions. Global similarities, These findings are likely to be reflected in other countries, including the United States, Stephenson said, underscoring ”some of the challenges individuals face in both changing behavior and maintaining” their resolutions. A 2017 Marist Institute of Public Opinion resolution poll of more than 400 people in the United States found smoking to be the seventh most popular resolution, chosen by 6% of those polled. The most common resolution was wanting to be a better person (16%) followed by wanting to lose weight.   In earlier studies by Norcross in 2002, the most popular resolutions still related to stopping smoking, weight loss and increasing exercise. Tips for success, To prepare your mind to succeed in maintaining your resolution, Norcross uses the analogy of learning a new sport or skill. A person doing that is likely to slip up and make mistakes    but they should then learn from those  .  ”Let’s say you wanted to learn tennis,” he said. ”People say they would have to take lessons, it would take some time, and they are likely to make mistakes, and that’s right.” The same is true when quitting smoking or committing to eating healthier foods.  Successful people know that a slip is not a fall, he said, and relapses are common    and expected. ”It’s like someone missing a shot in tennis and not playing again. It’s really quite silly when you think about it,” he said. But people should be encouraged by the survey numbers, Norcross said, adding that averaging across all resolutions, about 40% of people remain successful at six months. Once there, they are more likely to last the year. Both Norcross and Stephenson stress that willpower is not enough, not matter how much you may hear otherwise. ”In our studies, people who primarily relied on willpower failed at three times the rate of everyone else,” Norcross said, adding that many steps are needed to make a resolution last. ”It starts with getting prepared, rewarding yourself, developing a flourishing environment that supports you and creating the behavior.” Stephenson agrees, adding that people should ”not be discouraged if they relapse,” he said. ”It is difficult to maintain behavior change, but if you make small changes, it can have a huge effect.”"
31680,31705,50471,A low moment in sports broadcasting  ,CNN,,1/4/17,2017,1,," (CNN) At the beginning of this college football season, I reached into a dark corner of my closet and pulled out my favorite Penn State sweatshirt.  It was time, I told myself, to go back to being the proud alum and former cheerleader I was before convicted child rapist Jerry Sandusky, and disgraced head coach Joe Paterno, who helped cover up the scandal, brought shame to my university, and made me vow to never again cheer: ”We Are . .. Penn State.”  This season, watching my   Nittany Lions claw their way back to the top of the college ranks and ending up at the Rose Bowl, made me proud. No matter that they lost,   to USC, which scored a heartbreaking,   field goal. It was still a huge win for this   program and the new coaches and players who could only be considered innocent victims in a sick story. For one day, out in the glorious California sun, watching those boys play the game I love with grace and grit, I felt like Penn State had finally won back some respect. But it would be dishonest of me to say all is forgiven, or forgotten. I remain a hesitant college football fan and have no illusions about the corruption that   football programs can bring to a campus, especially regarding issues of domestic violence and abuse perpetrated by players or coaches. On the same day that the Nittany Lions were playing in the Rose Bowl, Oklahoma running back Joe Mixon took the field as his team faced Auburn in the Sugar Bowl. Mixon was embroiled in a scandal in December after a video released early last month from the 2014 incident shows him punching a woman in the face, fracturing bones. Instead of addressing the controversy surrounding Mixon, ESPN announcer Brent Musburger decided to dismiss it. His insulting sidestep of the domestic abuse case was a low moment in football broadcasting    and unfortunately not the first one for Musburger, who seems to have a problem talking football and respecting women at the same time.  ”It was troubling, very troubling to see. We’ve talked to the coaches. They all swear that the young man is doing fine. Like I said, Oklahoma thought he might even transfer, but he sat out the suspension, reinstated, and, folks, he’s just one of the best, and let’s hope, given a second chance by Bob Stoops and Oklahoma, let’s hope that this young man makes the most of his chance and goes on to have a career in the National Football League,” gushed Musburger, briefly mentioning Mixon’s suspension (for the entire 2014 season) over the incident, for which Mixon pleaded guilty to assault. (Oklahoma won the Sugar Bowl,  .) I’m all for second chances. But I am never all for men who ignore and excuse violence against women under any circumstances. And that’s just what Musburger did, going so far as to reiterate his position after fans watching the game expressed their surprise and disapproval on Twitter: ”’You know Jess, apparently, some people were upset when I wished this young man well at the next level. Let me make something perfectly clear. What he did with that young lady was brutal, uncalled for. He’s apologized. He was tearful. He got a second chance. He got a second chance from Bob Stoops. I happen to pull for people with second chances, OK. Let me make it absolutely clear that I hope he has a wonderful career and he teaches people with that brutal, violent video, OK? ’”  Musburger’s angry, defensive rant after fans across social media who justifiably criticized his lackluster reporting of the facts in the Mixon case, was unprofessional,   and wrong. As a woman who worked in sports for 15 years, I know it’s not easy to report on these stories. Athletes, coaches and media spend more time on the road together that they do with their own families, most times. And whether they admit it or not, many have conflicts of interest when it comes to reporting on the ugly side of sports. You don’t have to be a woman to grasp the seriousness of domestic abuse or to believe that each of these stories can be a teaching moment for our men, women and children. In fact, many of those who expressed their outrage at Musburger’s comments on social media were men. The fact is that the Musburgers of the world prolong the gender stereotypes that continue to thrive in the sports industry and prevent some of the most talented women in sports from rising to the broadcast booth, or the   making positions. At some point, that will begin to hurt your TV ratings and your money in a sport where 55% of women are watching.  The sooner we get men like Musburger    bumbling at best, dangerously sexist at worst    out of the broadcast booth, the better for sports all around. Then, just maybe, we can promote some of those football savvy women, who’ve been forever relegated to the sidelines, into that booth. I guarantee we would not be discussing sexist rants by announcers ever again. Now, that would be a refreshing  ."
31681,31706,50472,House Transportation chair: No infrastructure package in first 100 days,CNN,Rene Marsh,1/4/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN) The House Transportation Committee chairman said Wednesday there will be no infrastructure package in the first 100 days of Donald Trump’s presidency, breaking from a campaign pledge that Trump made repeatedly last year.  A massive infrastructure initiative was a big talking point for the   but Rep. Bill Shuster,   said not to expect plan details any time soon. Right now he says the focus will be figuring out how to pay for the   price tag. ”We’re going to start to work on it, but first of all, you’ve got to figure out the pay for it, which will come, I believe, in the first 100 days. Then in the next second 100 days is when we’ll put together a big infrastructure package,” he said. Shuster’s comments were first reported by The Hill. Trump often said he’d push for a $1 trillion plan to rebuild America’s infrastructure over a   period, though he provided little details on what that plan would look like. However, in a speech he gave in October outlining his ”First 100 Days” agenda, Trump listed it as a priority and his campaign outlined it as his No. 3 legislative priority, calling it the ”American Energy  Infrastructure Act.” The measure would aim to leverage   partnership and private investments through tax incentives, according to the campaign at the time. Trump also vowed to nix financial commitments to the United Nations for climate change programs and spend that money on water and environmental infrastructure instead."

S. and Russia as well as the reasons for tensions between the U. S. and Israel. After 10 seconds of trivia, we’re showing you what it’s like to be a freshman in the new Congress, and after a report on the social media ”filter bubble,” we’re showing you a walking robot that’s truly 10 out of 10. On this page you will find today’s show Transcript. TRANSCRIPT, CARL AZUZ, CNN TEN ANCHOR:  We are thrilled to bring you are our first ever  production of CNN TEN, a new   program that explains global news to  our global audience.  My name is Carl Azuz. And we are starting today by explaining the latest rift in the strain  relations between the U. S. and Russia. For months, the Obama administration has accused Russia of interfering in  last year`s U. S. presidential election.  More recently, it said Russia did  this to help incoming President Donald Trump get elected.   So, over the holidays, the U. S. government sanctioned, it penalized some  Russian intelligence services, some officers that work for them and three  companies that helped support Russian intelligence.  America also closed  two Russian compounds and expelled 35 Russian diplomats from the U. S. So, how did Russia respond?  Its president, Vladimir Putin, has repeatedly  denied interfering in the American election.  He said he would not, quote,  ”stoop to the level of irresponsible diplomacy” that he`d allow American  diplomats to stay in Russia and that he`d be working to rebuild relations  with the U. S. after   Trump is inaugurated. A lot of different perspectives on all this.  The head of WikiLeaks, which  published millions of hacked U. S. documents, said they did not come from  the Russian government.  Critics, including   Trump, have  said there`s not enough proof the Russian government was behind the hacks.   U. S. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the U. S. sanctions on Russia overdue  but said they were an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy  with Russia.  And Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham said the  sanctions don`t punish Russia enough. There`s also trouble in the relationship between the U. S. and Israel, an  American ally in the Middle East.  On December 23rd, the United Nations  Security Council passed a resolution.  It says that Israel is breaking the  law by building settlements on land it captured and claimed as its own  during a war in 1967.   The U. S. usually vetoes resolutions like this because it sees them as  overly critical of Israel.  But in this case, the U. S. abstained.  It  didn`t vote.  That allowed the U. N. resolution to pass when 14 other  members of the council voted for it. The resolution itself is mostly symbolic.  It doesn`t penalized  international trade or cooperation with Israel.  But it makes a statement  that infuriated Israel, which has accuses the Obama administration of  secretly supporting the resolution.  The U. S. government denies, but all  this has deepened the divide between America and Israel. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SARA SIDNER, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  As a rule, settlements are    communities that are on Israel occupied land that the Palestinians had  hoped to use as a future state.  And one of the sticking points here is  that the Palestinians feel like their land as been stolen and also that it  stops them from having a contiguous or continuous area to call their own  state.   The Israelis say, ”Look, some of this land is historically ours.  Some of  this land is politically ours.”  And also, they`re using some of the land  for security purposes. All in all, this is one of the sticking points in the process and one of  the things that Secretary Kerry has tried to undo.  But now, the gloves are  off.  Because of this U. N. resolution in particular, the Security Council  resolution 2334, you are seeing the reaction from Israel, especially Prime  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was furious over this resolution and  basically slapped Israel`s hand and said that they are breaking  international law by putting those settlements in place. And then we heard from Secretary John Kerry who talked about the fact that  he believes that this is a real sticking point, a real problem in trying to  go forward in a peace process. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AZUZ ( ):    trivia.  What part of the U. S. Constitution  says congressional terms start on January 3rd?  Article IV, the 14th  Amendment or the 20th Amendment? It`s the 20th Amendment that sets January 3rd as Congress` start date  unless the Congress changes the date by law. (END VIDEO CLIP) AZUZ:  And it was the 115th U. S. Congress that was sworn in on Tuesday.   Of the   Senate, 52 are Republicans, 48 are Democrats, that  includes two independents who vote with the Democrats.   Of the 435 voting members of the House of Representatives, 241 are  Republicans, 194 are Democrats. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. PAUL RYAN ( ) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Do you solemnly swear that  you will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against  all enemies, foreign and domestic, that you will bear true faith and  allegiance to the same, that you take this obligation freely without any  mental reservation or purpose of evasion, and that you will well and  faithfully discharge the duties of the office in which you are about to  enter, so help you God? MEMBER OF THE U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  I do. RYAN:  Congratulations.  You are all now members of the 115th Congress. (APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) AZUZ:  That`s what`s like to be sworn in to Congress.   Now for a look at what it`s like to be there for the first time.  There are  seven freshmen senators this term and 55 freshmen representatives.  Here  are two of them, along with their mutual hopes to work together. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REP. JACK BERGMAN (R) MICHIGAN:  I am Jack Bergman, and I am the new  freshman congressman from the first district of Michigan.   REP. VAL BUTLER DEMINGS (D) FLORIDA:  I am Val Butler Demings,  representing Florida`s 10th congressional district, from Orlando.  And I am  a new member of Congress. SUBTITLE:  One Republican, one Democrat, one mission. There are 54 new ”freshmen” members of the House who started work on  January 3rd. The two are also   presidents.  Val Demings is a retired police  chief, and Jack Bergman, a retired lieutenant general in the Marine Corps. BERGMAN:  People like us are sitting here today in these new freshmen  congressmen roles, because the people who vote said they want to see  something happen, different than what has been happening here in  Washington, D. C. in the recent past.  I believe that`s why folks like Val  and I got elected. DEMINGS:  Many times, we only focus on our differences, and not our  similarities.  And I believe it was a major moment for us to begin there,  not leading with our party.  I didn`t go through what I went through the  last two years and did put my family through it to get here and do nothing.   The only way we`re going to be able to get some things done is to work  together. BERGMAN:  Together, that`s how the Founding Fathers imagined it and that`s  how it needs to be. We`re only going to be a freshman once, and if we don`t take advantage as a  freshmen class, Dems and Republicans, to begin to make our mark in this  115th Congress, then we have missed an opportunity. (END VIDEOTAPE) AZUZ:  Strictly defined, an echo chamber is a room where the walls reflect  sound, giving it echoing sound effects.  Figuratively defined, it`s when  someone surrounds himself with ideas like his own and doesn`t get other  perspectives on a specific idea or issue.   This is what a lot of people have set up for themselves on social media,  though some may not even know it or have intended to create their own echo  chamber. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORTER:  It`s human nature.  We surround ourselves with people we agree  with, and the Internet has only made it easier.   For many, Twitter is the place to have existing views reinforced.  Often  without realizing it, a lot of us chose to live in an echo chamber, a place  where it can seem like everyone on earth is just like us. And Facebook, well, Facebook takes it even further.  Of course, you can  hide those posts from the group you`re on, but Facebook actually does a lot  of that work for you, behind the scenes.  It knows what you like and what  you comment on, what brands you follow, what ads grabbed your attention,  events you`re attending and publications you read.  Facebook uses all that  data to feed its algorithms.  And those algorithms choose what you see.  And if you know where to look, you can actually see what Facebook thinks  you like, your interest, your hobbies, and even your political views.  The  result is what`s become known as the filter bubble, where your timeline is  filled with opinions you share. Facebook actually makes money off knowing those things.  They sell you and  your filtered bubble to advertisers.  Those advertisers will pay more to  get their products in front of people that are likely to buy them.  And if  you`re seeing things you like, you`ll spend more time on Facebook, seeing  more ads and making the company more money. But does the bubble keep us  ?  It`s a tough question to  answer, especially while the technology is still changing so fast.  But one  thing is for sure, that technology has the power to make us more connected  or more isolated than ever. (END VIDEOTAPE) AZUZ:  Now for ”10 out of 10”.  Our last minute today goes to a robot  designed by a man who worked on movies like ”Transformers”.  You can pretty  much see that in the   a manned machine developed by a lab in South  Korea.  It`s taken more than two years and $200 million to bring the idea  to life.   It`s not finished.  The designer compares it to a baby taking its first  steps and they`re big ones.  The   weighs more than 1   tons.   So, there is the man in the machine and he`s got to love heavy metal.  Some  think it`s just a prototype to play Robocop, so you can keep your  mechanized field for that.  It`s certain there is a method to the madness  and that is ”10 out of 10” for CNN TEN, where the puns are intended and  automatic. I`m Carl Azuz.  Thank you so much for watching.  We hope you`ll take TEN  again tomorrow. Click for printable transcript. Please note that there may be a delay between the time when the video is available and when the transcript is published.

31684,31710,50476,Donald Trump’s fight with America’s spies,CNN,Stephen Collinson,1/4/17,2017,1,," (CNN)  Donald Trump’s feud with the intelligence community is taking on surreal overtones just over two weeks before his inauguration, raising the potential of unusual tension with the nation’s top spies when he moves into the White House.  Unless he changes course, Trump will take office having invested more credibility in the views of Russian President Vladimir Putin and WikiLeaks fugitive Julian Assange than in leading US intelligence agencies.  His dismissal of assessments by US analysts that Russia meddled in November’s election has already soured his ties with America’s leading espionage agencies. But his move Wednesday to invoke Assange, who has spilled some of the nation’s most closely held secrets, to raise questions about Russia’s influence in American politics could poison his relations with    intelligence operatives along with some leading Republicans on Capitol Hill. Trump defended himself Thursday, tweeting: ”The dishonest media likes saying that I am in Agreement with Julian Assange   wrong. I simply state what he states, it is for the people. ...to make up their own minds as to the truth. The media lies to make it look like I am against ”Intelligence” when in fact I am a big fan! But the clash is ultimately a battle of wits between Trump, who never likes to admit he is wrong, and intelligence agencies that insist they have the evidence to back up their conclusions about the Kremlin’s alleged election operation. The confrontation, and the political divisions it has opened, will be center stage on Thursday when Sen. John McCain presides over a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on foreign cyber hacking that will include testimony from the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.  Trump in 2010: WikiLeaks ’disgraceful’  ”This is a power struggle like we have never seen before between an incoming president and the intelligence community,” Rod Beckstrom, former head of the National Cybersecurity Center, told CNN’s Brooke Baldwin Wednesday on ”Newsroom.” ”In this case, Trump is making very clear from day one, ’I am the leader here, sit down and listen to me.’ He’s putting the (intelligence community) in an extremely difficult position.” Extraordinary decision, Trump’s decision to cite Assange was extraordinary.  While he is viewed in some quarters of the world as a heroic whistleblower, Assange is wanted in Washington over the publication of hundreds of thousands of documents related to the Iraq War and classified embassy cables. Some US officials believe his disclosures endangered US troops serving the field. He has holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012 and returned to prominence Tuesday evening when an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity    one of Trump’s biggest media backers    aired. Assange’s entire philosophy is to undermine US and allied governments. That’s what makes it so stunning that an incoming American president would go out of his way to cite him as a credible source.  Trump could hardly have cited a more radioactive figure had he been intending to insult US intelligence and State Department personnel who were left to deal with the fallout of one of the biggest leaks of classified intelligence ever. ”It’s a sad day when politicians place more stock in Vladimir Putin and Julian Assange than in the Americans who risk their lives daily to provide objective   intelligence analysis,” one US intelligence official told CNN. Those views are shared by many Republicans. ”In Julian Assange’s world, we’re the bad guys,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham told CNN Wednesday. ”Not the Iranians, not the Russians, not the North Koreans.” He added: ”You’ve got to remember who this guy is.” Trump attacks set intelligence community on edge, Trump’s series of tweets on WikiLeaks were not his only new swipe at US spy chiefs. On Tuesday, he complained that a scheduled briefing he had requested on the alleged Russian hacking had been delayed until Friday. ”Perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange!” Trump tweeted.  Intelligence agency chiefs said the meeting with CIA Director John Brennan and James Clapper, the director of National Intelligence, was never due to take place before Friday. Disconnect, The feud is already raising questions about how far the disconnect between the next president and the intelligence community    which is at the fulcrum of everything the US government does in the world    could harm US security. ”Let’s stare this reality square in the face: PEOTUS is   and believes Julian Assange over the @CIA. On Jan. 20 we will be less safe,” said George Little, a former CIA spokesman, on Twitter. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Trump’s statements were alarming. ”That he would now cite people like Assange who have demonstrated universal hostility to the United States and its interests takes him into new and even more treacherous territory,” he said in a statement. ”With every conspiracy   tweet and erratic    comment, the   does damage to our national security, while raising new concerns about his capacity to grow into the job.” Former House Intelligence Committee chairman Mike Rogers, a Republican who is now a CNN analyst, said Trump needed to undergo a ”maturation process.” ”He is going to need the CIA and the CIA is going to need him,” he told CNN’s Jim Scuitto on ”The Lead.” Aides on Capitol Hill say GOP lawmakers are privately expressing disbelief and incredulity at Trump’s continued insistence on believing Russia over the US intelligence community. Everything they have seen points to Russian responsibility for   activity, the aides say, and add that Republicans hope Trump comes around.  WikiLeaks’ Assange: Russia didn’t give us emails The estrangement between Trump and the CIA and other agencies represents an unorthodox strategy    even for Trump. One theory that might explain his behavior is his extreme sensitivity to any suggestion that his November election triumph was not legitimate. He appears to view debate about Russia’s role through that prism, and his aides have repeatedly tried to spin such talk as a Democratic plot to undermine him. Some intelligence community officials believe that Trump’s hostility might be based on a misunderstanding. ”The intelligence community is not saying that Vladimir Putin won the election for Trump,” one official told CNN on Wednesday. ”We’re saying they did a series of things to sow doubt and some people think they wanted Trump to win, but no one has ever said they got into the mechanics of the ballot boxes.” If it lingers, the bad feeling between the   and the spies he will soon command could also have a corrosive impact on the analysts and agents who do America’s most secret work. There will be fears for morale, especially among those who serve in covert missions in hostile foreign theaters with only a promise of a star on the CIA’s Memorial Wall if they are killed. CNN Intelligence Analyst Phil Mudd, who worked in   for the CIA, warned that Trump risked badly damaging his credibility. ”Who enters a management relationship dissing the entire workforce before they even meet not only the workforce but talk to the leadership of the workforce?” Mudd asked."
31685,31711,50477,New York City has safest year,CNN,,1/4/17,2017,1,,"New York (CNN) New York City just had its safest year on record. That was the message on Wednesday as police leaders and the city’s mayor gathered to tout   statistics, which tallied the lowest total of crimes reported since the NYPD started keeping such data.  It’s a message that contrasts sharply with America’s Second City, Chicago, which earlier this week reported its bloodiest year in nearly two decades. And it’s why Chicago’s top cop visited New York last month, NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill said. ”We told them what we were doing,” O’Neill said at a news conference in Brooklyn. ”We’re identifying the people in the communities    and it’s a very small percentage of the people    involved in the violence and we’re using all of our resources toward that end. That’s what we’re doing right.” Precision policing, as law enforcement calls the method, combined with an emphasis on community interaction, brought the city its success, officials said. The force saw 2, 000 officers added over the past two years, the largest increase in 15 years, officials said. The 2016 numbers, provided by the NYPD, are superlative: 998 shooting incidents, the smallest annual number in modern history and 12% less than the year before 335 murders reported, a nearly 5% decrease from 2015 and 15, 498 robberies, down nearly 9%. ”The fewest ever robberies in New York City. You can clap for that one, too,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said. ”For decades and decades when people thought, sadly, of crime and cities, they thought of New York City,” de Blasio said. ”A big tough city proved, we proved, that you can turn crime around.” The   crime statistics news conference was held at the Brooklyn Museum, where police had set up a display of photographs contrasting a 1980s and 90s New York    subway cars bearing graffiti and tent camps in Central Park    with clean, color photos of today. The new poster child for American crime, Chicago, on Sunday made a grim announcement: 762 murders in 2016.  It’s the highest figure for the city since 1997, and an increase of 50% from last year.  While the surge in violence in that city is rooted in its own, specific problems, including an influx of illegal weapons and a strained   relationship, the principals that brought the NYPD success ”can be universally applied,” O’Neill said. ”The way we do business here has evolved over the years and by focusing our resources on the people that not only do we identify but the community identifies as being involved in the violence, I think that’s how we can continue to push crime down and that’s how other cities can do it too,” O’Neill said."
31686,31713,50479,Living near a major road could be linked to higher dementia risk,CNN,,1/4/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Living close to a major roadway could increase your likelihood of developing dementia, according to a new study. Researchers found that people living within 50 meters (164 feet) of such a road had a 7% greater risk of developing dementia. The level of risk decreases proportionally, they say, with a 4% higher risk among people living 50 to 100 meters (328 feet) away and a 2% higher risk among people living 101 to 200 meters (656 feet, or about a 10th of a mile) away. People living more than 200 meters from a major road weren’t seen to have any increase in risk, according to the study, published Wednesday in the Lancet. ”There is a gradient of increased risk as you get closer to major roadways,” said Ray Copes, chief of environmental and occupational health at Public Health Ontario, who   the study. ”By the time you’re 200 meters away, the risk is essentially down to baseline.” In the study, a road was defined as ”major” based on daily traffic volume and was the equivalent of an interstate highway in the United States. ’Something different going on’ Previous research has suggested that exposure to air pollution and traffic noise could increase nerve degeneration within the brain. One recent study found that certain particles common to air pollution could enter the brains of people who breathe them in. With growing populations and greater urbanization taking place around the world, people are increasingly being forced to live in close proximity to major traffic arteries. Copes’ team decided to investigate the effect this could have on the onset of major neurodegenerative diseases, namely dementia, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease. The team tracked adults between 20 and 85 years old, living in Ontario, for 10 years between 2002 and 2012. Every adult in the province was included, making up 6. 6 million people, with their postcodes used to determine how close they lived to a major road and their medical records studied to find out whether they developed one of these three neurodegenerative conditions over the study period. No association was seen between proximity to a major road and the development of Parkinson’s disease or multiple sclerosis, but varying levels of increased risk    determined by the level of proximity    were discovered for dementia. ”There is something different going on with dementia,” Copes said. More than 47 million people have dementia worldwide, and 7. 7 million new cases are estimated to occur each year, according to the World Health Organization. There is no cure for dementia and no effective treatment, said Copes. The researchers warn, however, that for now, they have seen only a link and cannot state that living near a major road causes an increased risk of dementia. Another limitation is the fact that although postcodes help determine distance from a major road, the level of exposure for each individual included in the trial could vary. ”A single study can never definitely prove cause and effect,” Copes said, adding that the team adjusted for factors such as socioeconomic status, smoking, body mass index and education. ”The link continues to exist.” Two common pollutants    nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter    were also seen to be associated with dementia risk, but the team believes that other factors are likely to be involved in this link, such as noise from traffic. ”There is no single cause for dementia . .. but our study shows that one of the factors now appears to be exposure to traffic pollution,” Copes said. The team now plans to identify which pollutants are most responsible for the link and investigate the extent to which noise could explain the association.  ”We want to understand what are the causes and how effective existing interventions are,” said Hong Chen, associate professor in occupational and environmental health at the University of Toronto, who also   the study and wants to identify the potential impact of this newly identified risk.  A health concern for millions, ”The robust observation of dementia involving predominantly urban versus rural residents opens up a crucial global health concern for millions of people,” said professor Lilian   of the University of Montana, who wrote an accompanying article in the Lancet. ”The health repercussions of living close to heavy traffic vary considerably among exposed populations, given that traffic includes exposures to complex mixtures of environmental insults,” she said in a statement. The findings add to the growing understanding of how air pollution affects human health, but others in the field stress the need for further insight.  ”This study has identified major roads and air pollutants from traffic as possible risk factors for dementia, a finding which will need further investigation before any firm conclusions can be drawn about the relative risks of air pollutants for dementia versus other risks such as smoking, lack of exercise or being overweight,” said David Reynolds, chief scientific officer at Alzheimer’s Research UK.  ”This research is interesting in its identification of an association between dementia and major roads, but if any causal link exists between these two factors, it can’t be confirmed by this study,” he added. Though no link was identified between living near a major road and the development of multiple sclerosis or Parkinson’s disease, some experts believe this may be due to these two conditions being less common. It is ”worth pointing out that the numbers of people developing MS and Parkinson’s were much smaller than those developing dementia, so (numbers) may not have been large enough to show an effect if there was one,” said professor Tom Dening, director of the Centre for Old Age and Dementia at the University of Nottingham. But Dening added that attention should be given to the environments people are now being forced to live in. ”This study does ask serious questions about the environments where many people live. Undoubtedly, living in conditions of severe air pollution is extremely unpleasant, and it is hard to suppose that it is good for anyone.” Rob Howard, professor of old age psychiatry at University College London in the UK, agreed. ”Regardless of the route of causation, this study presents one more important reason why we must clean up the air in our cities,” he said. Copes believes that policies to reduce emissions in cities, better city planning that keeps residential areas away from major roadways, and designing buildings and ventilation systems to act as barriers to pollution are a few ways to alleviate the problem. ”There is a large burden associated with dementia,” he said. ”Prevention is really the key.”"
31687,31714,50480,"Omarosa to join Trump team, focus on public engagement",CNN,Suzanne Malveaux,1/4/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN) Omarosa Manigault will join   Donald Trump’s White House team in a role expected to focus on public engagement, a senior level transition source told CNN on Wednesday.  The Trump team officially announced the hire in a statement Wednesday afternoon. Manigault, who prefers to go by only her first name, was a prominent   surrogate for Trump during his campaign and served as his campaign’s director of   outreach. Her title will be assistant to the President and director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison focusing on issues such as community outreach. Chuck Schumer: Trump opposition leader, She gained prominence after she served nine weeks as a contestant in Trump’s reality TV show ”The Apprentice,” before he fired her. But she stayed close to Trump after she left the show. Her White House role was first reported by the Associated Press. This won’t be the first time Manigault has worked at the White House. She previously worked in the office of former Vice President Al Gore during former President Bill Clinton’s administration. And she wasn’t always a Trump supporter. In November 2014, she tweeted her support for Clinton, writing, ”I’m Ready for Hillary.

31688,31715,50481,Homicide charges dropped against ex-pro wrestler,CNN,,1/4/17,2017,1,," (CNN) A judge dropped all charges Tuesday against WWE Hall of Fame wrestler Jimmy ”Superfly” Snuka, who was charged with   murder and involuntary manslaughter in the death of his former girlfriend Nancy Argentino in 1983.  Lehigh County (Pennsylvania) Judge Kelly Banach determined that Snuka was incompetent to stand trial based on medical records and testimony provided by his defense attorney, Robert Kirwan II. Snuka, 74, has been diagnosed with dementia and showed signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, according to Kirwan. He went into home hospice care in October and was moved to   hospice care at Broward Medical North near his home in Florida on December 17. Kirwan filed a petition in February in which he asked the judge to rule Snuka incompetent to stand trial. The court held a   competency hearing in June, and the judge let six months pass in order to see whether his condition improved or worsened. At an unscheduled hearing Tuesday, Banach ordered all charges against Snuka dismissed. ”The court is satisfied that the defendant remains incompetent and the Court is satisfied that the defendant will not regain competence and it would be unjust to resume the prosecution,” the court order said.  Snuka was charged in September 2015, 32 years after Argentino’s death. She was found unresponsive in a room at the George Washington Motor Lodge in Allentown, Pennsylvania, on May 10, 1983. Snuka called the paramedics, but once they arrived, he was gone. Argentino was pronounced dead a few hours later. Snuka’s version of what happened that night varied, according to Lehigh County District Attorney James Martin. He claimed that Argentino fell as they were ”fooling around” outside the hotel room and that she slipped and hit her head as the two were ”clowning around” by the side of a highway. In light of the judge’s actions Tuesday, ”we are considering our options and will decide at the appropriate time what action we will take,” Leigh County District Attorney Executive Aide Megan Wieand said. Argentino’s family won a wrongful death lawsuit against Snuka in 1985, but authorities didn’t charge him in the death. It wasn’t until his 2012 memoir, ”Superfly: The Jimmy Snuka Story,” was published that Argentino’s family contacted Martin and asked his team to examine the book. Excerpts were presented to a grand jury, which decided to press charges. ”I was convinced that there was zero chance (the district attorney’s office) would be successful from the beginning,” Kirwan said. ”We were very confident that this would never result in anything other than dismissal.” Snuka was famous for his ”Superfly Splash,” a wrestling move in which he would stand on the ring’s top rope and vault off to land   on an opponent who lay prone on the ring floor. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, has become a concern for many athletes in contact sports. It is an Alzheimer’  neurodegenerative disease associated with repeated hits to the head. Nearly 100 former professional football players have been diagnosed with CTE, as well as former WWE wrestlers Jon Rechner, aka Balls Mahoney, and Brian Knighton, aka Axl Rotten.  Snuka also suffered from a bout of stomach cancer before he was charged in 2015. He was diagnosed in July 2014, and he had intensive surgery in which   of his stomach, some lymph nodes and part of his large intestine were removed, according to Kirwan. During the competency hearing, a doctor testified that anesthesia can worsen a person’s dementia, causing their symptoms to be more noticeable and advance at an alarming rate, Kirwan said. CTE cannot be diagnosed without a postmortem examination of a person’s brain, but the defense argued that Snuka exhibits signs of the disease based on outward symptoms and a series of MRIs taken over the course of two years. Snuka is one of 50 former wrestlers named as plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the WWE, filed in July, for   brain damage they contend was incurred during their careers with the company. "
31689,31717,50483,The Obamacare debate isn’t over,CNN,,1/4/17,2017,1,," (CNN) The question of whether Republicans should repeal Obamacare appears settled. Vice   Mike Pence was on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to rally his party’s lawmakers. Later in the day, the Senate voted   to begin debate on a budget resolution that would help pave the way for repeal of President Obama’s signature policy. But don’t be fooled. The debate over whether to scrap the law is not yet over, and what appears to be merely a question of timing is about much more than that. As a result, Republicans will have to tread a careful path that balances a desire to abandon Obamacare as soon as possible with the need to respect the reality that the complexities of changing the system will persist well beyond any   bill signing ceremonies.  Of course, now that the end of Obamacare appears in sight, with the election of a Republican president and the party’s control of the Senate and the House, a chorus of voices is urging delay and caution. And it’s true that widespread, sudden disruption of existing health insurance arrangements could   a workable transition to more   and less   health policy reforms. Hastily concocted political experiments on tens of millions of Americans could deliver unintended consequences.  Meanwhile, procedural and budgetary landmines on Capitol Hill also require careful planning, while holding together narrow working majorities    particularly in the Senate    as the Affordable Care Act is overturned will involve multiple compromises. Members must swallow hard and pull back from past rhetorical posturing.  But the reality is that such hurdles are by no means unique to Obamacare they exist whenever any major changes in direction for complex national legislation are proposed. Even the Obama administration and its allies had to drastically revise the plans it envisioned in January 2009 and accept whatever it could get through Congress 15 months later (it then spent another six years trying to revise a deeply flawed law through often desperate means).    And it should also be remembered that many of the voices eager to recount how hard all this is will have other agendas    many want to preserve the status quo, not because it’s particularly valuable or popular, but because they claim it’s just too late and too hard to change it. (Not coincidentally, some of the loudest naysayers benefit more from maintaining than scrapping the current system). Still, while the risk of ending up on the    of ACA replacement proposals lacking sufficient support, depth, or effectiveness is real, there are risks posed by the opposite reaction: the desire for quick and simple repeal.  Congressional leaders are well aware that other unexpected issues suddenly can crowd out and capture the attention span and political capital needed to execute the challenges of health policy reform. And they also have a   obligation to their voters to fulfill at least some portion of their longstanding campaign promises to repeal and (perhaps) replace (at least some parts of) Obamacare.  Ultimately, the current Congress and the incoming Trump administration cannot afford to walk away from this issue without being able to claim victory. To do so, they will likely start by taking one sizable leap for their supporters    repealing as much of the ACA as congressional procedures, budget scoring rules, and vote counts will allow in the first half of this year. As a result, some, but not all, of the repealed provisions will limp on for at least another year, if not longer.  In practice, that may mean something like the following moves:    quick repeal of the individual and employer mandates for insurance coverage,     delayed repeal of ACA taxes on the health care industry (at least until those sectors agree to ”play ball” with the new majority’s transitional plans)    continuation of insurance subsidies for 2017 that later become gradually revised (flatter and broader refundable tax credits) in future years, and     accelerated reductions in Medicaid’s coverage expansion through per capita allotments to states.  The next daunting phase of reform    involving the regulatory side of Obamacare    will require larger,   majority compromises in the Senate that will leave just about all parties unhappy. In other words, after a giant leap into the mostly unknown in the first half of 2017, some of the key political and policy facts on the ground will have changed. Republicans focused on maintaining their tenuous majority still face a steep and long climb. In this next stage, they will have to keep adjusting their tactics to the specific battles at hand involving replacement and transitional implementation. But one thing is certain    slipping backward is not an option for Republicans. Whatever comes next will require that they at least be able to declare victory."

The longtime ExxonMobil CEO was spotted at a Safeway supermarket Tuesday evening in Washington’s Dupont Circle neighborhood.  ”Yup. That’s Rex Tillerson in my local Safeway shopping like a plebeian,” Washingtonian Sanho Tree wrote in a tweet that has since gone viral. ”His security guy is about 20 paces behind him.” The accompanying photo shows Tillerson in the canned goods and pasta aisle, toting a basket filled with Raisin Bran cereal, milk and baby carrots, among other groceries.  The grocery store in question is (affectionately) known by locals as the ”Soviet Safeway,” Tree said in another tweet. ”Long lines, bad selection!” There is no parking and the small store lacks the selection of larger supermarkets nearby, such as the sprawling ”Social Safeway” in Georgetown.  Ironically, the   ”Soviet Safeway” shopper is known for his close business ties to Russia, having received the ”Order of Friendship” from Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2013. Many GOP senators, including John McCain, have expressed concern over Tillerson’s relationship with Russia.  Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, who will oversee Tillerson’s confirmation hearings, said Wednesday he expects the nominee to lead a robust policy toward Russia.  ”I had a long private conversion with him. I had talked to him on the phone prior to that,” said Corker. ”I think what people are going to find when they hear Tillerson in the hearing is that he’s very, very much in the mainstream of US foreign policy thinking.”"
31691,31720,50486,The meaning of tolerance in the Trump era,CNN,,1/4/17,2017,1,," (CNN) To understand the challenge facing those with friends and family members who voted for Donald Trump despite his open bigotry and misogyny, you need to watch a   exchange between a black woman and a white man and read about a decision Ellen DeGeneres was forced to make this week. Both incidents illustrate why sometimes it makes sense to be tolerant of opposing views, and other times it is imperative to separate yourself from potentially   relationships.   First, the   video. A white man called into the network’s ”Washington Journal,” which featured Heather McGhee, president of Demos, a liberal think tank. He confessed that he was prejudiced against black people because of images he had seen in the news but wanted to be a better American. ”What can I do to change?” asked Gary Civitello, a    disabled Navy veteran from North Carolina. McGhee’s gracious, empathetic response is the reason at least 8 million people have watched the video and why millions more probably will. She didn’t label him racist and demand he go away. Instead, McGhee befriended him, becoming a sort of guide, helping him to get a more rounded view of black people. McGhee’s story is the kind we love, much like the photo of a white police officer holding a distraught young black man caught in the middle of protests in Ferguson. Such stories have the power to touch those who didn’t believe they could be touched or needed to   what was in their heads and heart.  But the Ellen DeGeneres story is equally important. She had to disinvite a guest, singer Kim Burrell, whom she planned to have on her show. Burrell was to perform a song from the upcoming movie ”Hidden Figures” with Pharrell Williams. That was until a video surfaced of Burrell making disparaging statements about gay people. ”You, as a man, you open your mouth and take a man’s penis in your face. You are perverted,” Burrell said on camera during a sermon in a church. ”You are a woman and will shake your face in another woman’s breast. You are perverted.”  Burrell believes homosexual activity is a sin against God    to not spread that truth would be a violation of a deeply held principle and be harmful to gays and lesbians because they need to be made aware of their sins to repent.  And that’s why Burrell didn’t issue a full apology or retraction, even knowing DeGeneres is a lesbian and one of the country’s most visible, maybe most important, pioneering gay rights activists. DeGeneres had a few options. She could have allowed Burrell to perform as scheduled. She could have allowed her to come on the show and explain her comments. Or she could have disinvited her. In a world in which people prioritize comfort over justice, DeGeneres would have chosen either of the first two options. Instead, she chose the third. In a tweet announcing her decision, DeGeneres didn’t explain her reasoning. I suspect, though, she understood she was under no obligation to ”tolerate” someone who questions her core worth, even if that person does so because of a religious belief.  Unlike Burrell’s, Civitello’s story was compelling because he sincerely asked for a way to change, which is why McGhee’s response was pitch perfect. Burrell believes it’s DeGeneres who needs to change, which is why DeGeneres’ was pitch perfect as well. She has no obligation to spread a message that could further harm an   minority.  In short, Burrell can have her beliefs, but DeGeneres doesn’t need to cosign on them. Similarly,   voters do not have to embrace what we believe is a betrayal by friends, and even family members, when they didn’t declare that open bigotry in a presidential candidate was a deal breaker. There aren’t enough viral videos and photos in the world to obscure that truth. But it also doesn’t mean we must embrace hatred, become hostile or hope for the worst for Trump. We can still want to see the economy continue to improve in the Trump era, still want the concerns of the forgotten to finally be heard and still want the best for the country and our   friends and family members. We can still break bread with them and laugh with them and cry with them. Disagreement doesn’t mean a bridge too far. But we will not prioritize their comfort over our   or a relationship with them over our basic rights.  Trump’s bigotry wasn’t a deal breaker for them, but it was for us.  "

The   believes that had Dick Clark, the founder of Dick Clark Productions, been alive this audio mishap would not have happened. ”All I can say is Dick Clark was an incredible person and I was lucky enough to work with him when I first started in the music business,” Carey told Entertainment Weekly. ”I’m of the opinion that Dick Clark would not have let an artist go through that and he would have been as mortified as I was in real time.” Related Link: Mariah Carey: Dick Clark Productions slams ’defamatory’ and ’outrageous’ allegations she was sabotaged, Although Carey calls it a ”horrible” New Year’s Eve, she is thankful to have fans that support her during tough times.  ”My true fans have been so supportive and I am so appreciative of them and everybody in the media that came out to support me after the fact because it really was an incredible holiday season that turned into a horrible New Year’s Eve,” she said. Carey, who is about to embark on her ”All the Hits” tour, with Lionel Richie in March, said this won’t stop her from future live performances like the one on New Year’s Eve.  ”It’s not going to stop me from doing a live event in the future. But it will make me less trusting of using anyone outside of my own team,” she said.  Dick Clark Productions responded to Carey’s team on Monday, after a report suggested they purposely ”set [Carey] up to fail.” ”To suggest that DCP, as a producer of music shows including the American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, New Year’s Rockin’ Eve and Academy of Country Music Awards, would ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd,” Dick Clark Productions said in a statement. Entertainment Tonight claims Carey fired her longtime Creative Director, Anthony Burrell, following the performance. The report claims he had moved her backup singers off stage and that caused even more confusion for Carey.  When Carey took the stage for her   set she announced she was unable to hear anything coming from her earpiece. A publicist for Carey told CNN at the time: ”There was a production issue. Technical difficulties. Unfortunately there was nothing she could do to continue with the performance given the circumstances.” A source close to Carey said that as for her singing along to a track: ”It is not uncommon for artists to sing to track during certain live performances.”"
31693,31722,50488,Conservatives unveil repeal and replace Obamacare bill,CNN,MJ Lee,1/4/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN) A group of conservative House Republicans unveiled legislation on Wednesday to repeal and replace Obamacare. The political message behind the bill: It’s not true that Republicans don’t have a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act.  Members of the House Republican Study Committee, led by its chairman, Reps. Mark Walker, and Phil Roe, were emphatic in a news conference that the increasingly heated accusation from Democrats    that Republicans have failed to craft a plan to replace what they repeal from Obamacare    was simply not true.  ”I heard again on the House floor when I was down there. .. just a few minutes ago, how Republicans have no ideas. That’s absolutely false,” Roe said. ”We have a plan.”  Walker added: ”We’ve got to get out there, we’ve got to get runners on base.”  ”Our job is not to delay any longer,” he said. ”Our job is to come out of the gate with a particular piece of legislation that garnered more votes than any other legislation in both the 113th and 114th Congress.”  The legislation has been previously introduced by Roe, a physician from Tennessee, but has not received the endorsement of GOP leadership. While it is unlikely to become the main vehicle in the House to repeal Obamacare, it could attract support from a swath of House Republicans.  The bill includes several ideas that Republican lawmakers have advocated for years, such as tax credits to help offset the cost of health coverage and allowing Americans to purchase insurance across state lines.  The legislation also includes provisions to reform medical liability laws. To pay for the plan, the conservatives proposed an    cut in   domestic programs over the next several years.  The RSC’s proposal is likely to be one of multiple GOP proposals that emerge from the House and the Senate in the coming months as the Obamacare repeal and replace debate heats up. Earlier in the day, Walker acknowledged to CNN that the process would be complex and drawn out.  ”I would call this a Round One of a   heavyweight fight,” Walker said.  The unveiling of the Republican Study Committee’s Obamacare bill comes on the second day of the new Congress, as Republicans and Democrats are quickly drawing their battle lines on the ACA.  Touting the slogan ”Make America Sick Again” in a play off of   Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, Democrats are warning that Republicans are about disrupt millions of people’s health coverage    without offering an alternative solution.  And Republicans    as quick as they have been to get the process of repeal started    have acknowledged that they do not yet have a concrete plan to replace what they roll back.  GOP leaders are currently considering passing a repeal bill but holding off on the repeal from going into effect for a few years. But even this strategy, healthcare experts say, wouldn’t prevent insurance companies from fleeing the individual marketplace or spiking premiums    a reality that has some Republicans on edge about moving too quickly on repeal.  Vice   Mike Pence visited with GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill earlier in the day to chart a path forward on rolling back Obamacare.  In a press conference after the meeting, Pence told reporters that the party intends to draw from a ”broad range” of ideas as it starts crafting a replacement plan. ”Republicans have been offering those ideas again and again literally every year since Obamacare was first signed into law,” Pence said.  House Speaker Paul Ryan once again emphasized that a ”transition” period will be necessary.  ”We want to make sure that as we give relief to people to Obamacare, we do it in a transition that doesn’t pull the rug out from anybody during that transition period,” Ryan said.

Some of the posters attack Hillary Clinton, telling her to stay home and ”keep Monica away from Bill!”  Still others forgo ad hominem insults, declaring instead that ”We need background checks on politicians, not gun owners,” or simply ”Bullets not ballots.” Confusion and criticism  Matt Vann of Midland, Texas, passes through Mayhill on annual motorcycle rides with his friends. Other than the colorful    and often misspelled    invectives on display, Vann says the store ”is like any other store in a small town in the middle of nowhere.” A little over a year ago, he posted a photo of the storefront online, and some of his friends asked him whether the display was even legal. Vann says while he knows the store owner is within his First Amendment rights, ”he’s pushing it.” The Facebook page in the convenience store’s name (but not necessarily belonging to the store) has become a repository for scathing criticism. ”These owners don’t know what American values are,” one review said.  ”Not only are you a racist, but you are a coward,” read another.  The profile picture on the page is of a KKK hood.  ’We’ve seen it all’ One person who was not shocked by the malicious language was Vann himself. He and his friends work in law enforcement and unfortunately, he said, ”We’ve seen it all.” Although he doesn’t like to talk about politics, Vann believes it’s a foolish move for the business owner. ”Even people like me    people who are just patriotic    don’t want to be around that kind of stupidity,” he said. ”I think it’s about, you respect the (presidential) office and you respect the history and you respect the country. To me, it’s overboard.”"
31696,31725,50491,"The 2016 campaign is over, but the 2017 campaign begins",CNN,Dana Bash,1/4/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN) The 2016 campaign may be over, but the 2017 campaign just began. It wasn’t a 2008 style kickoff in Springfield, Illinois, or 2016 style start on Roosevelt Island, New York, or even a grand entrance on a descending escalator in a Manhattan tower.   In 2017, the campaign starting gun went off in dueling rallies inside the US Capitol, during an extraordinary morning of drama and theater emblematic of the coming Trump era. The Vice   arriving in one corner of the Capitol, and almost simultaneously, split screen, the outgoing president arriving in another. This year’s campaign is of course not about electing a president or member of Congress or any politician, it is about deciding the future of America’s health care system    something that affects all Americans, whether they voted or not. Just like in 2009, when Obamacare was before Congress and Democrats spread out across America to try to sell the law to their constituents, they’ll hold events back home starting this weekend to try to fight Republican plans to dismantle it. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley,   York, is leading the charge in the House, encouraging members to hold events in their districts this Saturday, January 7, in order to highlight what Democrats warn are the risks of repealing the Affordable Care Act. Next, Democrats are branding January 15 a ”National Day of Action” among Democratic senators, House members and   organizations. In his closed door pep rally with congressional Democrats, President Barack Obama even encouraged his party to use tea party tactics to galvanize Americans to urge Republicans not to dismantle the health care plan    which happens to be the cornerstone of his legacy. But the analogy is hardly perfect. Anyone who remembers the raucous town halls of 2009 knows it was the Democrats trying to sell Obamacare who got shouted down by constituents who didn’t like the law, and were encouraged by conservative media and the brewing tea party movement.  Still, there could be a silver lining here for Democrats.   their base is wounded, disoriented and scared. It’s similar to the way the Republican base looked and felt back in 2009 after Obama won and the Democrats took a supermajority in the Senate. The GOP was in the wilderness, and the fight against Obamacare became a motivator for Republicans to find their way back. If done right, and if successful, this new campaign to save Obamacare could rejuvenate despondent Democrats. As for Republicans, they realize their campaign is fraught with peril. Just look at the  ’s own tweets. He woke the morning of this 2017 campaign start and took to Twitter to warn his own Republican brethren to ”be careful” not to go too far in their zest for repeal.  Vice   Mike Pence expounded on that after meeting with House Republicans. ”It will be important that we be careful as we do that. that we do that in a way that doesn’t work a hardship on American families. who have gained insurance, through this program    doesn’t work hardship on our economy,” said Pence. But he also lifted the veil on Republican concerns that their push to repeal Obamacare may get drowned out by Democrats stories of real people who have benefited from the program, and warnings about loss in insurance coverage and rattled markets a repeal may bring.  That’s what Pence meant when he admonished GOP members: ”Remind American people of what they already know about Obamacare that the promises that were made were all broken, and I expect you’ll see an effort in the days ahead to talk about the facts around Obamacare.” When   House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel argued forcefully to use the Democrats huge 2009 majorities to pass health care reform, he did so by predicting that once Americans have a benefit, they won’t want to lose it. It is going to be a long 2017 as we watch and learn whether he was right."
31697,31726,50492,Istanbul shooting: Horrifying scene inside massacre nightclub,CNN,Sara Sidner,1/4/17,2017,1,," (CNN) In a New Year’s terror attack on an Istanbul nightclub, 39 people were killed and dozens injured by a lone gunman. CNN’s Sara Sidner and Mohammed Tawfeeq gained access to the club and describe the distressing scene inside. The Reina nightclub can be accessed two ways, by land or by sea. Its beautiful large wooden terrace sits on the water and opens up to a stunning view of the Bosporus.   Towering above the club is the bridge that links two continents, Asia and Europe. The Reina’s location is in the perfect spot to bring East and West together. That was exactly its aim and it worked.  World travelers and locals alike flocked to what had become one of the most famous nightspots and restaurants in town. The upscale club was known for offering guests a chance to live the glamorous life, if only for one night.  Now it will be known for something else. In seven minutes everything changed. That’s how long it took for a gunman to kill 39 people inside. That’s how long the gunfire lasted, according to staff members.  Blood soaks walls, We were allowed in to see the scene the gunman left behind. Every effort had been made to wash away the blood but there was simply too much of it. The splatter still soaked a portion of a wall, a hat, a holiday decoration. A hole the size of a half dollar remains in the glass over the doorway that leads inside to one of the dance floors and bar. The large cushioned red sofas and chairs are strewn about as if the room had been hit by a flood and the items had drifted slightly off center of where they were supposed to be.  To the left a raised portion of the club is covered in clothing.  On the   couches, clothes with sequins and sparkles are strewn about. Purses with colored jewels gleam on the table. On the floor, women’s shoes, all different types and colors, lie scattered. Many items will never reach their owners, Some of these items may never be picked up. Their owners have no use for them. They didn’t make it out alive. On the lower level a gas canister sits alone. Intact on one side, it is pierced by bullet holes on the other. Video has shown the attacker shooting at it, apparently intent on making it explode. He failed. There was no gas inside. Considering the   weapon and the amount of gunfire, there are few bullet holes. The most visible are the large gouges in the base of the wooden bar. There is a reason for that. Witnesses say the gunman was calculated. He wasn’t just spraying bullets everywhere. He was going table to table and shooting people point blank. His plan was to kill as many as possible. The Reina nightclub will never be the same. Named after one of the owner’s daughters, its name means queen. Sixteen years after the doors opened, the owner is unsure if he can bear to open again."
31698,31727,50493,Morning sickness drug called into question,CNN,,1/4/17,2017,1,," (CNN) One minute, you have that blissful pregnancy glow, and the next, you’re green with nausea. You’re not alone. About 75% of women suffer nausea and vomiting during pregnancy due to morning sickness, and about 1% experience a severe form of the sickness called hyperemesis gravidarum. Many    are prescribed some type of treatment to ease their morning sickness, from vitamins to medications. Diclegis, also known as Diclectin in Canada, is the only Food and Drug   prescription medicine for morning sickness, according to its website. It’s so popular that reality star Kim Kardashian posted a promotional Instagram photo about it in 2015. Now, a provocative new paper questions the efficacy of the drug. There were flaws in the 1970s clinical trial that the FDA and the federal department Health Canada used to approve the drug, then known as Bendectin, according to the paper. It was published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One. The clinical trial, known as the   Bendectin Study, was never published in a scientific journal, said Dr. Nav Persaud, a physician and associate scientist at St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto and assistant professor at the University of Toronto, who   the new paper.  ”I was surprised that there were so many serious problems with a study that forms the basis for approval and prescribing,” he said. ”I have stopped prescribing this medication.” Duchesnay Inc. the Canadian pharmaceutical company behind Diclegis and Diclectin, responded that the medication’s safety and efficacy have been proved in other more recent studies and  . Other experts also stand by the drug, and the FDA called it ”safe and effective.” ”Based on the available data, the FDA determined that Diclegis has been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnant women who do not respond to conservative management. The FDA’s determination remains unchanged,” according to a statement emailed by FDA spokeswoman Sarah Peddicord on Wednesday. ”Generally the FDA does not comment on specific studies, but evaluates them as part of the body of evidence to further our understanding about a particular issue and assist in our mission to protect public health. The FDA is reviewing the findings of the paper. The FDA remains committed to informing the public in a timely manner when the agency identifies concerns about approved drug products.” ’This is a flaw’ In the   the combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine was approved by the FDA for the treatment of morning sickness under the name Bendectin. Starting in the late 1970s, a series of lawsuits and studies claimed that the drug was associated with birth defects. The medication was voluntarily withdrawn from the American market in 1983 due to falling sales and rising legal costs. Then, ”this company Duchesnay applied to start selling the same two active ingredients under the name Diclegis,” Persaud said.  In 2013, the FDA approved Diclegis to treat pregnant women experiencing nausea and vomiting. Persaud and Rujun Zhang, a colleague at the University of Toronto, submitted freedom of information requests to the FDA and Health Canada to obtain data from the   Bendectin Study as part of an initiative to systematically restore and publish old trials, called RIAT. In their paper, the researchers noted that they selected the trial because it was a critical component in the FDA approval and involved a commonly used drug. The researchers reviewed about 36, 000 pages of information from the FDA, of which about 7, 200 were related to the clinical trial. They also obtained 359 pages from Health Canada, but 212 were redacted. The researchers used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, a commonly used method, to assess the quality of the clinical trial. After examining the papers and analyzing the original   Bendectin Study, the researchers found that out of the 2, 359 patients who initially enrolled in the weeklong trial, 31% never completed it.  ”This is a flaw, because the missing data could change the findings and conclusions depending on what happened to those women,” Persaud said. He added that the final results of the clinical trial also were missing. Additionally, the clinical trial involved a scoring system to measure how patients responded to Bendectin compared with a placebo group, and the researchers found the system to be unclear. Although the new paper does not suggest that Diclegis causes birth defects, the researchers wrote, ”The questionable data integrity, high   rate, and other methodological concerns mean that the prescribing of this medication should not be based on this trial.” Debate over drug drives on, Duchesnay has complete confidence in the safety and efficacy of Diclegis, company spokeswoman Amy Feldman said in an emailed statement Tuesday. Diclegis is a combination of the antihistamine doxylamine and pyridoxine, or vitamin B6. The two active ingredients ”are the most studied drug combination used in pregnancy,” the statement said. In July, Health Canada released a summary safety review confirming that the drug’s benefits continue to outweigh its risks.  The drug’s safety and efficacy ”have been proven in 16 cohort studies, two   an ecological study, a neurological development study and numerous others,” the statement said. ”It is estimated that 35 million women around the world have used the combination of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride to treat nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.” Indeed, the FDA required two studies    the 1970s study and a 2010 study published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology    to approve Diclegis, Persaud said. Although the 2010 study showed the efficacy of the combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine in the drug, the 1970s study was referenced to show the efficacy of each ingredient individually. In other words, ”if you were to subtract the 1970s study, the FDA could not have approved Diclegis,” Persaud said. According to the FDA’s statement, the agency ”took into account the totality of the evidence submitted when deciding whether Diclegis could be approved.” The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Association of Professors of Gynecology and Obstetrics still both consider Diclegis a   treatment for morning sickness when more conservative treatments fail, the Duchesnay statement said. ”I have no idea why they would dredge up data that is 35 years old,” Dr. Laura Sirott, a practicing   and California state legislative chairwoman for the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a separate email about the new paper. ”A multitude of data from this century exists to show the safety and efficacy of the drug. As stated in their article, what data they do have is heavily flawed,” she said. However, another expert expressed doubt. With some information from the original   Bendectin Study trial still missing, it is difficult to determine whether Diclegis is effective, said Marlena Fejzo, a medical scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. ”So I would have to agree with the conclusion of the Cochrane review that there is insufficient evidence,” said Fejzo, who has studied morning sickness but was not involved in the new paper.  ”Given that it is prescribed for one out of every two live births in Canada, I would strongly recommend repeating an effectiveness study as soon as possible,” she said. For now, if you are experiencing morning sickness, Persaud recommended talking to your doctor about treatment options.  A controversial history, There’s a controversial history around drugs used to treat morning sickness    and accurate data about what’s effective can be hard to come by, Fejzo said. ”This is due, in part, to the thalidomide disaster of the 1950s, when the drug was prescribed to women with hyperemesis gravidarum to relieve symptoms of nausea and babies were born with limb deformities,” she said of the drug thalidomide, which is no longer prescribed for morning sickness in the United States. ”This led to difficulty in developing and testing medications on pregnant women.” Pregnant women are often excluded from   clinical trials designed to test the efficacy of certain drugs, according to a 2013 paper published in the journal Obstetrics  Gynecology. The paper found that only about 1% of clinical trials between 2011 and 2012 were designed specifically for pregnant women. Due to this lack of research, less than 10% of medications approved by the FDA since 1980 have enough data behind them to determine their risk for birth defects, according to a 2011 study published in the American Journal of Medical Genetics. To help with this lack of data, Fejzo said, she recommends that all health care providers be required to report the medications they prescribe their patients during pregnancy. ”A centralized, national database to document treatments and medications and their effectiveness, and maternal and child outcomes could help us figure out which medications are safe and effective,” Fejzo said. ”This would increase patient and provider confidence about using treatments during pregnancy. It would also reduce the risk of malpractice or class action suits, which make drug companies and doctors hesitant to test and prescribe new treatments,” she said. ”With so many women taking medications, both   and   to treat pregnancy nausea, the answer is there.”"

31700,31731,50497,Winter storm will bring snow to South,CNN,Judson Jones,1/5/17,2017,1,,"Atlanta (CNN) Nervous residents have flocked to grocery stores in anticipation of snow in the South this weekend. A winter storm is expected to sweep through the Southeastern United States late Friday and early Saturday, bringing a potential mix of snow, sleet and ice. Raleigh, North Carolina, is likely to face the brunt of the storm, with 4 to 10 inches of snow predicted. Charlotte is looking at some   inches of snow, and CNN’s meteorologists believe at least an inch of snow is likely to fall in Metro Atlanta, with potential for up to 4 inches.  The National Weather Service has issued winter storm watches for Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas    including such metropolitan areas as Atlanta, Birmingham, Alabama and Greenville, South Carolina. A winter storm watch means there is potential for significant snow, sleet or ice accumulations that may impact travel. Lighter accumulations of snow are forecast for portions of Mississippi, Tennessee and Virginia. ”The heaviest snowfall will be expected to fall from the southern Appalachians to southeastern Virginia,” said the National Weather Service, adding that ”most precipitation will begin to taper off by Saturday evening.” Many schools and universities weren’t taking any chances. Atlanta students will go home two hours early Friday and Georgia Tech will close at noon. The University of Alabama is suspending operations for the day. As customary, residents in warning areas flocked to grocery stories to load up on bread, milk and more. Alex Preston of Atlanta wrote with his photo of long lines: ”Because of a snow flurry . .. really?” While hardy folks from the North often scoff at Southerners for the clearing of store shelves, we might be able to thank a particular region for at least some of it,  according to AccuWeather. com. ”It appears that New Englanders can take credit for the purchasing of milk and bread prior to the storm,” the site reported last year. ”It was the monumental blizzard in 1978 that trapped many in homes for weeks that gets at least some credit for the current tradition.” Amid the run on goods, forecasters are telling people to take warnings and watches seriously. Major airlines issued advisories about potential impact. Flightaware, which tracks cancellations, on Thursday evening did not show a large number of those for Friday and Saturday, but those numbers could quickly change. Snowstorms in the South are notoriously difficult to forecast, as timing or a change of 1 or 2 degrees can be the difference between several inches of snow or just a cold rain. National Weather Service meteorologists called the forecast ”tricky” in their discussion of the storm Wednesday.   There is still some uncertainty, as a few forecasting models show precipitation arriving before the temperatures cool down enough to create snow. As the storm develops out of the Gulf of Mexico there is chance that a narrow band of forecasted higher snow totals could widen, producing heavier snow across a broader area. And depending on where the   line falls, some areas could see a mixture of rain and snow in the beginning, which would keep snow totals down. This is especially likely in places like Birmingham, where the storm will begin earlier on Friday    most likely as a wintry mix of snow and sleet. There is a chance the air will remain just warm enough in places farther south that the precipitation will just fall as sleet. The best news about this storm is that it will happen on the weekend, which should prevent another ”snow jam” scenario like the one that paralyzed Atlanta in January 2014. During that storm tens of thousands of weekday commuters left work around the same time, creating massive gridlock on roads and highways and stranding vehicles for hours."
31701,31732,50498,"Trump asking Congress, not Mexico, to pay for border wall",CNN,Manu Raju,1/6/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN)  Donald Trump’s transition team has signaled to congressional Republican leaders that his preference is to fund the border wall through the appropriations process as soon as April, according to House Republican officials. The move would break a key campaign promise when Trump repeatedly said he would force Mexico to pay for the construction of the wall along the border, though in October, Trump suggested for the first time that Mexico would reimburse the US for the cost of the wall.  Trump defended that proposal Friday morning in a tweet, saying the move to use congressional appropriations was because of speed. ”The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed) will be paid back by Mexico later!” Trump tweeted Friday. New York Rep. Chris Collins said Friday that American taxpayers would front the cost for the wall but that he was confident Trump could negotiate getting the money back from Mexico. ”When you understand that Mexico’s economy is dependent upon US consumers, Donald Trump has all the cards he needs to play,” Collins, congressional liaison for the Trump transition team, told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota on ”New Day.” ”On the trade negotiation side, I don’t think it’s that difficult for Donald Trump to convince Mexico that it’s in their best interest to reimburse us for building the wall.” The Trump team argues it will have the authority through a   2006 law to build the wall, lawmakers say, but it lacks the money to do so. Transition officials have told House GOP leaders in private meetings they’d like to pay for the wall in the funding bill, a senior House GOP source said. Intel report says US identifies   who gave emails to WikiLeaks, ”It was not done in the Obama administration, so by funding the authorization that’s already happened  a decade ago, we could start the process of meeting Mr. Trump’s campaign pledge to secure the border,” Indiana Republican Rep. Luke Messer said on Thursday. Messer admitted it’s ”big dollars, but it’s a question of priorities.” He pointed to a border security bill that Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul proposed last year that cost roughly $10 billion. ”Democrats may well find themselves in the position to shut down all of government to stop the buildout of a wall, or of a barrier, or of a fence,” Messer said. Mexican leaders have repeatedly said they will not pay for the wall.  The Associated Press and Politico first reported elements of the talks earlier Thursday. If Mexico refuses to pay for the wall, the GOP could add billions of dollars into the spending bill that needs to pass by April 28 to keep the government open. But doing so would force a showdown with Senate Democrats and potentially threaten a government shutdown. No decisions have been made, GOP sources said. Republicans point out that  . Barack Obama, Sen. Chuck Schumer and  . Hillary Clinton voted for the 2006 bill and argued that since Democrats backed that bill, they should support efforts to fund the current effort. The thinking behind the strategy is that it is harder for Democrats to filibuster spending bills because of the high stakes involved if they fail to pass in time. Black Caucus launches longshot effort to derail Sessions’ nomination as attorney general, Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 3 Republican in the House leadership, declined to say Thursday if Congress would pay for the wall. ”We want President Trump to have all the tools he needs to build the wall,” Scalise said. ”We’re in talks with him on the details of it as they’re still putting together their team. We still got a few months before there’s another funding bill that’s going to move. We’re going to work with him to make sure we can get it done. We want to build a wall. He wants to build a wall.” Could Mexico pay for the border wall?  Trump himself has estimated his border wall would cost $8 billion, though other analysts have estimated the price would be as much as $10 billion. And the proposals Trump has outlined to coerce Mexico into paying for the wall involve controversial measures that would still likely fail to cover the wall’s full cost. According to Trump’s website, those steps could include: remittance seizure, potential tariffs and foreign aids cuts, increasing fees on temporary visas issued to Mexican CEOs and diplomats, increasing fees on border crossing cards, increasing fees on NAFTA worker visas and increasing fees at ports of entry to the US from Mexico. A major challenge for judging Trump’s proposal is that most of those steps amount to a drop in the bucket    less than $1 billion    compared to the proposed cost of the wall. And the one step that could provide the required amount of money    remittance seizure    would face major legal obstacles, in addition to the likelihood of severe domestic and international backlash. Total US foreign aid to Mexico is less than $200 million a year ($186, 000, 000 in the 2014 fiscal year) so redirecting all of that money to a border wall would only put a mild dent in the $8 billion bill. And it’s difficult to know the amount of revenue generated from a tariff on Mexican exports    or to account for potential losses from a retaliatory tariff    without the specifics of the tax.  Moving next to fee increases, Trump says on his website that ”even a small increase in visa fees would pay for the wall. This includes fees on border crossing cards, of which more than 1 million are issued a year.” But the fees for visas and border crossing cards range from around $150 to $200 each, according to State Department data. Accounting for all the fees on over a million border crossing cards and visas in a year year    and even accounting for a twofold increase in those fees    that would still only generate about half a billion dollars, well short of an $8 billion price tag.  The biggest potential source of money for the wall would come from remittance seizure: remittance payments are money that immigrants, legal and illegal, earn in their country of residence and send back to their families in their native country.  According to the bank of Mexico, Mexico received $24. 8 billion in remittance payments in 2015. A Fox News Latino report calculated that 97% of remittance payments received by Mexico in the first three months of 2015 came from the US, and the Pew Research Center similarly reported that ”nearly all” of Mexico’s remittance payment revenue comes from the U. S.” Seizing all of that money would probably be more than enough to pay for the border wall. Trump says on his website that he would use the Patriot Act to require legal identification for money transfer transactions, according to his website. But CNN legal analyst Paul Callan says Trump’s plan would likely face multiple legal battles. ”The Mexican immigrants Trump seeks to target are clearly not the ’Radical Islamic Terrorists’ that the Patriot Act was designed to fight,” says Callan. ”The courts are likely to view Mr. Trump’s use of the always controversial Patriot Act as an improper and illegal use. The proposal may also fail to place pressure on the Mexican government as money can be smuggled back to Mexico in many other creative ways if wire transfers are cut.” The size of Mexico’s remittance revenue far surpasses any other   proposal from Trump, and would probably be the most effective way to pay for the border wall. But looking at the obstacles that such an action would face, it’s difficult to envision a path to impounding those payments to pay for the wall."
31702,31733,50499,Republican Obamacare fan hopes Trump’s stance softens,CNN,Jessica Ravitz,1/6/17,2017,1,,"West Palm Beach, Florida (CNN) If it had been only about what was best for him, Bob Ruscoe would have cast his ballot for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. But he’s a staunch Republican, always has been, and that meant this Obamacare beneficiary struggled over his November vote in a way he never had before.   ”I agonized over the decision,” he said. ”Part of me was saying, ’if she gets in, at least we won’t have to worry about health care for four years.’ ”  Ruscoe, 57, of West Palm Beach, Florida, is   and knows the insecurity of going uninsured. He took advantage of the Affordable Care Act the minute he could. About 20 million people gained health care coverage through Obamacare. With more than 1. 7 million Floridians enrolled as of February, the Sunshine State has the highest percentage of Obamacare recipients in the country. And yet Ruscoe was among the majority of Florida voters who checked the box for Donald Trump, the candidate who promised time and again to spike the program Ruscoe couldn’t wait to have. ”We’ll have to see what pans out,” he said. ”It may not be totally repealed. It may be something else. I hope something will remain in place.”  He went with the candidate he thinks will make America stronger.  ”I did what I thought was correct for the overall good of the country,” he said. ”Economic strength cures a lot of things.”  A better economy, he hopes, will free him from needing subsidies. Having no choice, For most of his adult life, health insurance was a comfort Ruscoe took for granted. Between him and his wife, at least one of them had a job with health care benefits.  He left his position in ceiling fan sales to venture out on his own about 13 years ago, only after their daughter was grown, the house was mostly paid off and he had a little pension. Ruscoe is responsible like that. Then, his wife lost her job. Other than the nasal polyps that have long plagued his sinuses, they were a pretty healthy pair. Plus, they had the option of COBRA coverage for 18 months.  That benefit ran out, though, and so did prospects for health insurance    at least for him. Ruscoe weighed about 300 pounds at the time, and try as he might, he couldn’t find a policy to cover him. He knew he could stand to lose some weight, but he’d been an amateur athlete and remained active and strong. He didn’t see himself as unhealthy, but that didn’t matter.  ”They wouldn’t sell it to me at any price,” he said. ”It was the reality of the situation. I didn’t have a choice.” Still, Ruscoe, who’s since lost 100 pounds, doesn’t blame anyone but himself. ”I was overweight, so I was a risk,” he said. ”I wouldn’t have wanted to insure myself.”  ’Coming out of the rain’ For his wife, he bought catastrophic coverage. It wasn’t cheap    about $200 a month    and it came with a whopping $25, 000 deductible. This meant they both avoided doctors as much as they could.  So on those occasions when his sinuses swelled shut and he couldn’t sleep for days at a time, he felt helpless. ”I had no reasonable means to get help,” Ruscoe remembered. He’s a liquidator, and his wife joined him in the business. They buy abandoned storage unit items and goods leftover from estate sales and then resell them. It’s a physical job that keeps him lifting objects, transporting boxes and jumping into and out of big moving trucks.  Ruscoe has gotten some nasty gashes along the way, but he had no problem taping those up himself. But when he tumbled out of a truck, a year or so before Obamacare emerged, being uninsured terrified him. He remembers the moment his foot got stuck and he began to fall. He says he felt like Wile E. Coyote, of Looney Tunes fame, hanging in the air right before gravity kicked in. The thought bubble above his head would have read, ”This is really going to suck,” he said.  When he hit the ground, he couldn’t breathe. After he caught his breath and began to wiggle his fingers and toes, he was stunned to be in one piece. He got bruised up but knew it could have been a lot worse. Had he landed differently, medical expenses might have ruined him. So Ruscoe took notice when the Affordable Care Act began making news.  ”I thought it was a good idea, even though I’m a conservative,” he said. ”It’s a social program, but a lot of social programs are for the good. And this is one of them.” The moment the website went live, he was online, ready to sign up. It had been several years since he’d been insured, and he remembers the relief that came over him.  ”It’s the feeling of coming out of the rain, if you will,” he said. ”You can do all you can to get healthy. You try to be safe. But there’s a certain amount of fate that’s just out there.”  No guarantees, The value of coverage was immediate. During wellness checks, something he and his wife had ditched in their time without insurance, she learned that she had high cholesterol. And though he’d worked hard to lose a significant amount of weight, he’d plateaued. Once a doctor offered nutritional counseling, he shed the last 40 pounds. Irrespective of political persuasion, he says, having access to services that keep people healthy makes sense. He couldn’t understand friends who didn’t take advantage of the health care opportunity. ”It’s made to be affordable for everyone. Why wouldn’t you?” he asked. Come February 1, he’ll be paying about $338 a month for himself and his wife. Without Obamacare, he says, the same plan would cost them $1, 150 a month    or close to $14, 000 a year. Rates like that would mean no more insurance for them.  They’re not getting any younger, and Ruscoe knows that there are no guarantees when it comes to health. He thinks of his grandmother who died of colon cancer and talks about the importance of preventative medicine, including access to procedures like colonoscopy. ”I’ll be bellying up to get my first one this year,” he said.  Without insurance, he’s not sure that would be possible for him and his wife. Ruscoe doesn’t pretend to know how   Obamacare is and assumes it requires tweaking. But he hopes the Trump administration will recognize and hold onto what’s worked.  He  feels like it’s his ”civic duty” to speak up, he says. It’s important to remind people that slashes to coverage may lead to ”a segment of the population that’ll be left swinging in the breeze.”  His views will surprise some of his friends, he suspects. ”They’ll freak out that I was strongly considering voting for Clinton,” he said. ”But I think she would have been very compassionate, and you need that.”  Ruscoe’s now banking on Trump showing some compassion, too.

31703,31734,50500,Trump’s spiritual adviser fires back at critics ,CNN,Daniel Burke,1/5/17,2017,1,," (CNN)  Donald Trump’s longtime religious adviser, Paula White, is firing back at critics who have called her a heretic and questioned her personal finances and romantic history.   ”I have been called a heretic, an apostate, an adulterer, a charlatan, and an addict. It has been falsely reported that I once filed for bankruptcy and     my personal favorite    that I deny the Trinity!” ”I have hesitated to even address such patently false accusations about my personal life and my beliefs so as to not dignify them with a response,” White said in a statement. The    pastor is one of six religious leaders scheduled to participate in Trump’s inauguration on January 20.  ”But since these comments pose a potential distraction to an otherwise celebratory and historic time in our country, I would like to set the record straight in the hope of returning our collective attention to what’s most important.”   In a Thursday appearance on CNN’s ”OutFront,” White called the wave of criticism ”amazing” and said there was ”absolute absurdity” to a lot of the accusations facing her. She reiterated the claims she made in her statement and blasted those who called her faith into question, particularly over her divorce. ”God knew everything I would go through before I ever went through it,” White told CNN’s Erin Burnett. ”Not everything is perfect in my life, but I don’t think everything is perfect in anybody’s life.” White, a megachurch pastor and televangelist in Florida, has long been a controversial figure in Christian circles, where many find fault with her promotion of the ”prosperity gospel,” which teaches that God bestows health and wealth on true believers, particularly those who donate money to ministers.  In 2007, the Senate investigated White and other televangelists who had made millions from their ministry. According to an audit made public by a Senate committee, White’s former church, Without Walls International, took in $150 million between  .  At one time, White and her   owned an airplane and several multimillion dollar properties, including a condo in Trump Tower. Like Trump, White has been married three times. After White’s divorce from her second husband in 2007, the church they led together plunged into bankruptcy. Her current husband is Jonathan Cain, the keyboard player for Journey and a   of the epic hit ”Don’t Stop Believin’.” In her books and sermons, White has spoken of her troubled early years, including sexual abuse she suffered as a child and family members’ addictions to drugs.*  ”My life and my decisions have been nowhere near perfect, though nothing like what has been falsely conveyed in recent days,” White said. Much of the recent criticism of White has focused on her theology, not her personal life. Evangelicals in particularly have fretted that White’s role in the inauguration and closeness to Trump could ”mainstream heresy.” Besides their issues with the prosperity gospel, conservative Christians have accused White of denying the Trinity, a core Christian doctrine since at least the 4th century. In a recently surfaced video, White appears to agree with the statement that Jesus is ”not the only begotten son of God,” which contradicts the Nicene Creed, a foundational statement of Christian belief.  In her statement, though, White says, ”I believe and have always believed in the Holy Trinity,” as well the rest of the Nicene Creed, including the ”exclusivity and divinity of Jesus Christ.”  The pastor also struck back at critics who accuse her of peddling a ”  gospel,” saying that she has preached and written as often about the ”difficult seasons” of life as she has about ”times of abundance.” For his part, Trump, who has faced questions about his own commitment to Christianity, has called White ”a beautiful person both inside and out.” White said she and the   have been close since he called her a decade ago to discuss sermons he had heard her deliver on Christian television.  ”She has a significant message to offer anyone who will tune in and pay attention,” Trump has said of the pastor. ”She has amazing insight and the ability to deliver that message clearly as well as powerfully.”   *An earlier version of this story reported that Paula White had spoken of her struggles with drug addiction. In fact, she was talking about her   Randy.  The   gospel of Donald Trump "
31704,31736,50502,Former CIA chief cuts ties with Trump,CNN,Eli Watkins,1/6/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN) Former CIA Director James Woolsey downplayed his role Thursday in   Donald Trump’s transition, days after he publicly disputed the  ’s views on Russia’s role in the 2016 election. In a statement, he formally announced he would no longer serve as an adviser to Trump. But he insisted in an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett that the move had nothing to do with his comments on Russia, only that he wanted to avoid any confusion about his role with Trump. Earlier this week, Woolsey told CNN’s Jim Sciutto he believed the Russians were involved in   hackings of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. Then, speaking to CNN’s Don Lemon on Wednesday, Woolsey criticized WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, whom Trump has invoked on Twitter to defend his skepticism of US intelligence assessments of Russian meddling in the election. Woolsey insisted to Burnett Thursday that he was not leaving because he was frustrated with Trump’s public dismissal of US intelligence findings. He said he had actually not advised Trump in some time and wanted to set the record straight on who he was and what he did. ”I didn’t want to fly under false colors,” Woolsey said. ”I’m not really functioning as an adviser anymore, and so when I’m on the screen, everybody announces that I’m former CIA director and that I’m a Trump adviser. And I’m really not anymore. So I just thought I should strike that from the (TV banner) . .. so nobody was under false impressions.” He said he still supported Trump and wished the incoming commander in chief well, but that he was not a part of his team anymore. He said there was no ”particular point” that he had stopped advising Trump, but added he had only seen the   in person a few times and talked on the phone ”a little bit.” ”I didn’t want to be claiming that I’m something I’m not,” Woolsey said."
31705,31737,50503,US keeping closer watch on North Korea,CNN,Barbara Starr,1/5/17,2017,1,," (CNN) The US military and the intelligence community are taking an even closer look at North Korea’s weapons and military activities, CNN has learned. Starting in 2017, any development or movement of personnel, weapons and key leadership decisions inside North Korea are being more heavily analyzed for indications of upcoming actions by the regime, two US defense officials told CNN. Both officials emphasized that North Korea has always been closely watched by US satellites and surveillance aircraft and radars. But now, more intelligence analysts will be scrutinizing the data collected to ensure nothing is missed. South Korea speeds up creation of Kim Jong Un ’decapitation unit’ The move is being made in part because of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s New Year’s statement that he was pursuing the possible launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile.   Donald Trump responded that he will not allow North Korea to develop nuclear missiles that could reach the US. It’s not believed Kim was directly threatening an imminent launch of a missile, with or without a nuclear warhead, but rather was emphasizing his commitment to the missile program. Both US officials told CNN that it appears North Korea’s weapons program remains relatively quiet at this time with no signs of an imminent intercontinental missile launch, although there are indications that   missiles continue to be moved around. Nonetheless, the US officials have indicated they will continue to pay extra attention to any North Korean intelligence throughout the rest of the US presidential transition and through the early days of the Trump administration because of concerns Kim could see it as a period of vulnerability for the US. Officials say one unanswered question is how Kim may react to provocative tweets by Trump."
31706,31738,50504,"Talladega College band will perform at inauguration, school president says",CNN,,1/5/17,2017,1,,"Talladega, Alabama (CNN) Students in the marching band of a historically black college in Alabama welcomed the announcement by the school’s president Thursday that they will participate in inauguration festivities for   Donald Trump. The decision follows several days of controversy after the Talladega College Marching Tornadoes initially accepted an invitation to perform on January 20, with critics saying the move amounts to support for Trump. He made comments during the presidential campaign that were widely viewed as disparaging to people of color and immigrants. College President Billy C. Hawkins announced the final decision in a statement, noting that the ”lessons students can learn from this experience cannot be taught in a classroom.” ”We respect and appreciate how our students and alumni feel about our participation in this parade,” said Hawkins. ”As many of those who chose to participate in the parade have said, we feel the inauguration of a new president is not a political event but a civil ceremony celebrating the transfer of power.” Band members said Thursday they were excited for the chance to represent the    ensemble and their college.  Head drum major Devon Julian, 21, of New Orleans, said it would be ”an honor and an accomplishment.”  ”Not too many people could say they were able to march for a president of the United States in an inaugural parade,” Julian said in the Talladega College band room. Taesha Mathews, 20, of Talladega, said the backlash against the band’s plan to perform hasn’t bothered her. ”No matter what people say about the [band] we will always keep marching on, with or without your support.”  ”It’s not all about the president,” said Shylexis Robinson, 19, of Atlanta. ”It’s about the band and what we want to do and how to get our band out there.” Not everyone on the campus was pleased with the decision. ”I think with Donald Trump being the type person he is, the band shouldn’t go,” Ike Chukwuelue, 25, a Talladega student from Atlanta, said Wednesday. ”Marching in that parade would basically be siding with Trump and his ideals and the way he chooses to go about politics.”  College founded by former slaves, Chukwuelue, speaking on campus, also was worried that marching in the parade could affect enrollment. ”What kid are you going to get to come here now after you just marched for Trump in a parade?” he said.  The controversy sparked rival petitions    one first started by a graduate of the school asking The Great Tornado band to withdraw    and another by a band member in support of performing. Talladega, which was founded in 1867 by former slaves, has 800 students. It is Alabama’s oldest private historically black liberal arts college, the school said.  ”We have a reputation of fighting for freedom and equal rights and justice and he doesn’t stand for any of that,” said Shirley Ferrill.  Ferrill, a 1974 graduate, started the petition calling for the band to withdraw. She said she was most offended by Trump’s November 2015 rally in Birmingham, in which a Black Lives Matter protester was beaten, punched and kicked by white men in the crowd. Hawkins said the school’s administration did not rush to accept the invitation because it wanted to ”hear and consider the thoughts and feelings of the Talladega College community.” He noted that while the event is considered a ”    experience for the students,” the school must now raise more than $60, 000 to cover the expense of the trip to Washington. Inaugural claims record number of applicants, The school learned that it had been tapped to perform in a December 21 letter addressed to the band from parade organizers. The letter congratulated the band on being chosen.   Who is performing at Trump’s inauguration and who isn’t? ”We had a record number of applicants, so our selection is a testament to your organization’s talent and enthusiasm,” the letter said. Eight days later, the school’s band director faxed the required information to organizers. The next day, Trump’s inaugural committee listed the Talladega band on an initial lineup of performers. Talladega resident Donald Morgan, a retired teacher who has four Talladega College graduates in his family, said the band would be playing for the office of the presidency    not specifically for Trump    and ”for the country and for humanity.” Quoting first lady Michelle Obama, Morgan, 62, said: ”When they go low, we should go high. We’re going to respect him whether we like him or not because he is the president of the United States.”  Morgan said Talladega College had long provided opportunities for   to get higher education after schools such as the University of Alabama refused to admit black students. ”Now we can go anywhere . .. even to Washington to perform for the president of the United States,” he said."
31707,31739,50505,GOP seeks to punish UN with funding cut after Israel vote,CNN,,1/5/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Congressional Republicans are prepping legislation to slash US funding to the United Nations, saying it’s the right response following last month’s Security Council vote condemning Israeli settlements.  The conservative House Freedom Caucus will meet Monday to discuss whether to move forward with efforts to reduce funding to the world body or to require Congress to reauthorize the spending every two years or it will cease.  Last month, the UN General Assembly raised the organization’s   budget to $5. 6 billion from $5. 4 billion. The US is currently the largest contributor, with its funding making up 22% of the UN’s budget. Japan follows at 9. 68% and China at 7. 92%.  The move to slash US funding to the UN by congressional Republicans was triggered by the Obama administration’s decision to abstain from a Security Council vote earlier this month that declared Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem illegal. Without the US veto, the Security Council passed the measure.  Oklahoma Rep. Jim Bridenstine is developing the legislation, according to Buzzfeed, which first reported the story.   Sen. Lindsey Graham, who had lobbied members of the Security Council to oppose the settlements resolution, will lead the GOP effort in the Senate to hit the UN in its wallet.   ”I am a huge supporter of foreign aid and the UN,” the South Carolina senator told CNN after the Security Council vote. ”I want to do more, not less. But I can’t support funding a body that singles out the only democracy in the Middle East who shares our values.” He added, ”This is a road we haven’t gone down before. If you can’t show the American people that international organizations can be more responsible, there is going to be a break. And I am going to lead that break.” Texas Sen. Ted Cruz also called for cutting US funding to the UN until the vote is reversed.    Donald Trump, who publicly called on the Obama administration to veto the resolution, expressed dismay at the UN vote on Twitter.  Graham hopes cutting funding to the UN will give Trump more ”leverage” to force change.  ”Trump is a good negotiator. Let’s see if this give him some leverage,” he said, adding that if the world body overturned the measure, the UN ”has got a chance to reset and let the new administration restart the peace process.” Meanwhile, the House disapproved overwhelmingly Thursday night of the UN’s decision last month to condemn Israel over settlement construction. A resolution disapproving of the UN decision passed   with four voting present. The vote, which is   is not related to the measure congressional Republicans are prepping to slash US funding to the UN."
31708,31741,50507,Intel report says US identifies go-betweens who gave emails to WikiLeaks,CNN,Evan Perez,1/6/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN) US intelligence has identified the   the Russians used to provide stolen emails to WikiLeaks, according to US officials familiar with the classified intelligence report that was presented to President Barack Obama on Thursday.   Donald Trump is scheduled to receive a briefing Friday.  In a Fox News interview earlier this week, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange denied that Russia was the source of leaked Democratic emails that roiled the 2016 election to the detriment of   Donald Trump’s rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton. Meanwhile, US intelligence has received new information following the election that gave agencies increased confidence that Russia carried out the hack and did so, in part, to help Trump win.  Included in that new information were intercepted conversations of Russian officials expressing happiness at Trump’s win. Another official described some of the messages as congratulatory.  Officials said this was just one of multiple indicators to give them high confidence of both Russian involvement and Russian intentions. Officials reiterated that there is no single intercepted communication that qualifies as a ”smoking gun” on Russia’s intention to benefit Trump’s candidacy or to claim credit for doing so. Related: WikiLeaks’ Assange: Russia didn’t give us emails, A declassified public version of the Intelligence community’s review of the   cyber hack will be released as soon as this afternoon, according to a US official. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi announced at a news conference Friday that the gang of eight congressional leaders were briefed before those members of the intelligence community went to New York to brief Trump. ”Stunning in its conclusions and you will see some of it,” Pelosi said. Vice President Joe Biden said in an interview with PBS NewsHour that an unclassified version of an intel report provided to him will be released ”very shortly” and will ”lay out in bold print what” the US knows about the hacking. ”I think it will probably confirm what a lot of the American people think,” he said, adding that it would ”state clearly” the Russians involvement in the hacking.  In response to the interview, Trump tweeted on Wednesday, ”Julian Assange said ”a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta”   why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info!” Trump has been publicly skeptical of Russia’s involvement in the hacking, as well as has been publicly deriding the US intelligence community for its unanimous conclusion that Russia hacked Democratic Party groups and individuals to interfere in the US presidential election. Officials told CNN there’s been a disconnect between Trump’s remarks about the intelligence community and his    behavior when he’s present at private intel briefings."

31710,31743,50509,Police: Nabbed escapee resembles robberies suspect,CNN,,1/5/17,2017,1,," (CNN) A Rhode Island prison escapee matching the description of a man who tried to rob two banks earlier in the day was collared by a Massachusetts trooper after a foot chase, officials said Thursday. James Walter Morales, who was not armed, did not put up resistance when Trooper Joseph Merrick caught him after a bank robbery attempt in Somerville, Massachusetts. Morales, who was caught as he tried to jump a fence, was identified by a tattoo, officials said. Col. Richard McKeon praised Merrick and others involved in the manhunt for ”bringing an end to this dangerous fugitive’s attempt to escape justice.” Earlier Thursday, a man who closely resembles Morales, a    former Army reservist, tried to hold up a bank in Cambridge, but fled before getting any money, according to Trooper Dustin Fitch, spokesman for Massachusetts State Police. While it’s unclear whether the robbery try involved any weapons, state police previously issued a release warning that Morales should be considered armed and dangerous. After interviewing witnesses and reviewing surveillance video from inside the bank, they believed that Morales, the subject of an intense regional manhunt since New Year’s Eve, was likely the person responsible, according to Fitch. The Cambridge robber was wearing a black jacket with a gray sweatshirt, black knit cap, a scarf and black sneakers, according to Boston FBI field office spokesperson Kristen Setera.  Morales escaped from the maximum security Wyatt Detention Center on New Year’s Eve. He will make an initial appearance Friday in Providence, Rhode Island, related to the escape, federal authorities said. Morales allegedly stole a car in Attleboro and drove to Framingham, where his former girlfriend lives, according to CNN affiliate WCVB. Morales was in federal custody for the theft of 16 guns from the Lincoln W. Stoddard U. S. Army Reserve Center armory in Worcester, according to authorities, Morales was also wanted out of Middlesex County, Massachusetts, in an alleged sexual assault of a child. Morales was out on bail in that case when the armory theft occurred, according to authorities."
31711,31744,50510,Effort to defund Planned Parenthood threatens Obamacare repeal,CNN,Deirdre Walsh,1/5/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN) A push by Republican congressional leaders to defund Planned Parenthood could threaten passage of their   legislation to repeal Obamacare because of opposition to the   provision by two key GOP senators.  House Speaker Paul Ryan announced Thursday that Republicans will move to strip all federal funding for Planned Parenthood as part of the process they are using early this year to dismantle Obamacare. Congressional Republicans have tried for years to zero out all federal funding for Planned Parenthood because the group provides abortion services. The fight over Obamacare helped trigger a   government shutdown in 2013, and Democrats and President Barack Obama insisted any Planned Parenthood provision targeting the group be removed from a bill to fund federal agencies.   The decision to add the controversial Planned Parenthood language, which is opposed by most Democrats, could have a major impact on getting the Affordable Care Act repeal legislation through the Senate because supporters need the backing of at least 50 of their 52 members and two   senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, won’t commit to approving the bill with the Planned Parenthood provision in it.  Further complicating matters for Senate GOP leaders is Sen. Rand Paul,   who announced this week he plans to vote against the Obamacare repeal legislation because the underlying budget measure it is attached to doesn’t balance and adds to the deficit. If Murkowski, Collins and Paul all voted against the budget bill, it would be enough to torpedo the Obamacare repeal legislation. ”I’m going to wait and see what happens,” Collins told reporters, indicating she thinks it’s too early to decide how she will vote on the bill.  ”Obviously, I’m not happy to hear the speaker wants to include defunding of Planned Parenthood, an extremely controversial issue in the package.” Murkowski’s told reporters Tuesday she was still weighing the issue. In 2015, she joined Collins in voting for an amendment to strip Planned Parenthood funding out of a budget bill that would have also repealed much of Obamacare. But Murkowski ultimately backed the repeal measure even though it had the   Parenthood provision, which Obama ultimately vetoed. ”At this point and time, I have not been involved in a sit down with colleagues about specifics of reconciliation. So it’s tough for me to speculate or engage in any conjecture,” Murkowski said earlier this week. ”We’re going to be having a lot of discussions about that probably as soon as this week.” When asked her position Thursday, Murkowski’s spokeswoman Karina Petersen said, the senator ”is concerned about defunding Planned Parenthood as she is a longtime support of Planned Parenthood and has opposed broadly defunding the organization.” Republicans could drop the Planned Parenthood measure, but doing so could spark anger from the   of their party and potentially make it harder to defund the organization at a later date. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in his chamber, said ”that’s certainly where I am” when asked if he wanted to include defunding of the organization into the repeal measure. But he noted ”that’s place we start” and that nothing has ”finally been decided yet.” ”While we would like to have all 52 senators, if we have a vice president in the chair, that gives us a little bit of flexibility on reconciliation,” Cornyn said Thursday, referencing the ability of the vice president to break Senate ties. The vast majority of federal money that Planned Parenthood does receive funds preventive health care, birth control, pregnancy tests, and other women’s health care services. Democrats also point out that much of the money the group received is through the Medicaid program, which reimburses health care clinics that provide care to those covered by the federal program. Under the   ”Hyde amendment” that is attached to annual funding bills, no federal money is allowed to go to programs that include abortion services, unless they are needed to preserve the life of the mother or are caused by rape. Democrats immediately denounced the news that Republicans again were working to bar future federal funds for Planned Parenthood. ”This is a priority for the Republicans,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Thursday afternoon. ”So I just would like to speak individually to women across America: this is about respect for you, for your judgment about your personal decisions in terms of your reproductive needs, the size and timing of your family or the rest, not to be determined by the insurance company or by the Republican ideological   caucus in the House of Representatives. So this is a very important occasion where we’re pointing out very specifically what repeal of the (Affordable Care Act) will mean to woman.”  Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, told CNN’s Erin Burnett on ”OutFront” Thursday that ”concerned” women have lobbied against the move throughout the day. ”His phone has been jammed up today,” Richards said.   rights groups point to a letter that the Trump campaign signed in September pledging support for ”Defunding Planned Parenthood as long as they continue to perform abortions, and   their funding to community health centers that provide comprehensive health care for women.” ”Vulnerable   Democratic senators need to do a serious gut check, especially following the 2016 election outcome, and decide if they will stand with their constituents and women’s health care or continue to funnel money to big abortion,” warned Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony List, an   group, in a written statement."
31712,31746,50512,"Chicago torture video: 4 charged with hate crimes, kidnapping",CNN,Holly Yan,1/5/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Four suspects have been charged in connection with the attack on a   teen that was streamed on Facebook Live.  Jordan Hill, 18 Tesfaye Cooper 18 Brittany Covington, 18 and Tanishia Covington, 24, have each been charged with a hate crime, felony aggravated kidnapping, aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.  Hill, Cooper and Brittany Covington also face charges of residential burglary. Hill also faces charges of possession of a stolen motor vehicle.  Video of the torture has stunned the country, not just because of the graphic abuse, but because of the comments made by some of the assailants.  ”*F*ck Donald Trump!” one attacker shouted in the video. ”F*ck white people!” The  teen was tied up for four or five hours, Cmdr. Kevin Duffin of the Chicago Police Department told reporters. The victim will recover from his injuries and is at home with his parents, police said.  The teen’s    spoke briefly with reporters Thursday night. ”We’re so grateful for all the prayers and efforts that led to the safe return of our brother. We’re fully aware of the charges being brought against the offenders. At this time, we ask for continued prayers for all those involved, for our family’s privacy as we cope and heal,” David Boyd said, reading a statement. Boyd said the teen is doing as well as can be expected. He told the media that everyone in the family has seen the video, but he didn’t comment further on it.  Duffin said the department sought hate crime charges because of the victim’s diminished mental capacity, the fact that the four suspects tied him up and the racial epithets heard on the video. The victim apparently is white the suspects are  . The suspects will appear in court Friday. Facebook Live is changing our world    is that a good thing?  30 minutes of horror, Video of the attack shows the    victim cowering in a corner of a room, tied up with his mouth bound in plastic. His eyes exude fear as his attackers get ready for their next act.  One assailant slashes his sweatshirt with a knife. The young woman streaming the abuse on Facebook Live repeatedly turns the camera back to herself.  An attacker then takes a knife to the victim’s head, carving a patch off his scalp.  For the next 25 minutes, the abuse continues for the world to see. The victim is repeatedly kicked and punched, but his screams are apparently ignored.  The young woman broadcasting the attack appears dismayed that she’s not getting more attention online.  ”Y’all not even commenting on my s***,” she tells a friend during the live stream.  Debate over ’Black Lives Matter’ Many who saw the video have blamed the Black Lives Matter movement. Within 24 hours, the hashtag #BLMKidnapping was mentioned more than 480, 000 times on Twitter. But on Thursday, police said they have not seen any connection to the Black Lives Matter activist group, contrary to some reports on social media. Neither the Black Lives Matter national organization nor its Chicago chapter responded to CNN’s request for comment Thursday. But DeRay Mckesson, a prominent Black Lives Matter supporter, said those linking the attack to the movement don’t have their facts straight. ”It goes without saying that the actions being branded by the   as the ’BLM Kidnapping’ have nothing to do   the movement,” he tweeted. A former Chicago police officer, Dimitri Roberts, slammed the notion that the Black Lives Matter movement is to blame.  ”This is hate. And hate doesn’t have a color,” Roberts said. ”So for folks to talk about this is somehow connected to Black Lives Matter is absolutely the wrong way to look at this. . ..  And we cannot respond to hate with hate. It’s just going to perpetuate the cycle.”  President Barack Obama said the Facebook live torture video is ”despicable,” suggesting to CNN affiliate WBBM it was a hate crime. ”What we have seen as surfacing, I think, are a lot of problems that have been there a long time,” said Obama, a longtime resident of Chicago. ”Whether it’s tensions between police and communities, hate crimes of the despicable sort that has just now recently surfaced on Facebook.” ”The good news is that the next generation that’s coming behind us . .. have smarter, better, more thoughtful attitudes about race,” Obama said. What constitutes a hate crime, According to the city of Chicago’s website, ”Hate crimes are acts of bigotry, and are committed because of the intended victim’s actual or perceived ancestry, color, creed, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability (including HIV status) or national origin. Hate crimes not only harm the victim, but also the group in which the targeted member belongs.” And according to Illinois law, hate can be considered an aggravating factor in a criminal charge and can result in a more severe sentence.  The fascinating, if unreliable, history of   tracking in the US, The assailants made a wide array of statements in the video, including repeated references to Donald Trump, white people in general and the victim’s appearance. How the encounter started, The victim’s parents reported him missing Monday, telling police they had not heard from their son since dropping him off Saturday at a McDonald’s in the Chicago suburb of Schaumburg, about 20 miles from their home in Crystal Lake. The victim was supposed to spend New Year’s Eve with Hill, who picked the teen up in a stolen van, Duffin said.  Hill drove the teen around for several days in the van    they apparently spent at least one night in the vehicle    before they went to the Covingtons’ apartment in Chicago. Police said Hill and the teen were acquaintances who knew each other from school.   At one point, Hill and the teen got into a play fight that escalated and he was tied up for hours, police said. A resident in another apartment complained about the noise and the two sisters went to the home and kicked down the door. The neighbor called 911.  Police responding to the call found the teen on the street wearing an   tank top, shorts and sandals. ”He was bloodied, he was battered,” Officer Michael Donnelly said. ”He was very discombobulated.” Video discovered, Police in Streamwood, which borders Schaumburg, said that after the man was reported missing to them, his parents began getting text messages from someone ”claiming to be holding him captive.”  Officers investigating the texts ”discovered a Facebook video depicting (the man) being verbally and physically abused.” It’s unclear what alerted the police to check Facebook. Soon after they discovered the video, Streamwood investigators said they were contacted by Chicago police, who said they had found the missing teen. After viewing the Facebook video, they determined the victim was the teen found on the street    and the people arrested were involved, police said. Video pulled from Facebook, Facebook said it pulled the original video from a suspect’s Facebook profile. ”We do not allow people to celebrate or glorify crimes on Facebook and have removed the original video for this reason. In many instances, though, when people share this type of content, they are doing so to condemn violence or raise awareness about it. In that case, the video would be allowed.”  ’Facebook Live’ torture video raises ethical questions for social media giant, According to its community standards, the company removes content, disables accounts and works with law enforcement in cases of a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to public safety.  Facebook users also can report offensive material to the social platform. If a live stream starts blowing up, Facebook staffers monitor it for possible violations and interrupt it if needed. "
31713,31747,50513,CBC aims to derail Sessions’ AG confirmation ,CNN,Deirdre Walsh,1/6/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Members of the Congressional Black Caucus launched what they admitted was a ”longshot” effort to block Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions’ nomination to lead the Department of Justice in   Donald Trump’s Administration. ”He has been hostile to every community that DOJ is supposed to protect from discrimination,” Indiana Democratic Rep. Andre Carson told reporters at a Capitol Hill news conference Thursday. A number of Senate Democrats have signaled they will oppose Sessions’ nomination, but Republicans control the chamber and none have expressed any opposition. West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin has also praised Sessions and said he would vote for him, another factor indicating he is on track to serve as the next attorney general. Sarah Isgur Flores, a spokeswoman for Sessions, defended his record. ”As attorney   Jeff Sessions has been endorsed by   and civil rights leaders who know him and know that he has has dedicated his career to upholding the law and ensuring public safety,” Flores told CNN. ”Those groups that want to score cheap political points by smearing his name do not have the facts on their side.” Louisiana Democratic Rep. Cedric Richmond, who chairs the CBC, acknowledged the chances were slim that they’d be able to successfully derail his confirmation as attorney general. ”None of our fights have ever been easy and we don’t let the fact that it may be a longshot ever deter us and we are fighting for the justice of everyone in America,” Richmond said.   Thirty years ago, Sessions was nominated for a federal judgeship but during his Senate confirmation hearing he was accused of making racist remarks, a charge he vigorously denied. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted down his nomination, but the Alabama Republican went on to serve as attorney general in his home state. He was elected to the Senate in 1996 and was one of the first members of Congress to endorse Trump’s presidential campaign. RELATED: Sessions dogged by old allegations of racism, Richmond, asked if he believed that Sessions was racist, didn’t directly answer but said his ”his beliefs are discriminatory, his actions are discriminatory.”  He added ”if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it’s a duck.” Multiple members of the black caucus pointed to concerns with Sessions’ positions on voting rights, immigration and civil rights. They also took issue with his position on the Justice Department’s role in addressing clashes between local communities and police departments. Sessions’ supporters maintain that the Capitol Hill group does not speak for all African Americans and that the Alabama Republican has support from a number of black leaders.  Currently there are 49 members of the CBC, but only two are Senators    New Jersey Senator Cory Booker and California Sen. Kamala Harris. Neither participated in Thursday’s news conference focused on Session’s nomination. RELATED: Arrests end NAACP   at Jeff Sessions’ office"
31714,31749,50515,"When Kuwait was on fire, they saved the day",CNN,,1/6/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Oil wells, deliberately set on fire by ISIS, have turned skies black in and around Mosul, Iraq’s   city. The terror group’s   tactics are reminiscent of the 1991 Gulf War, when Saddam Hussein’s forces ignited hundreds of oil wells as they retreated from Kuwait. Photographer Sebastiao Salgado was in Kuwait back then as oil workers fought the flames and eventually stopped the spill, the largest in world history. It took nearly an entire year. ”Moving like phantoms through the gloom, covered in oil for hours on end, these men were too close to danger to think of anything but the job at hand,” wrote Salgado, who documented the disaster in his new book, ”Kuwait: A Desert on Fire.” ”It demanded experience, improvisation, discipline, solidarity and immense toughness of body and mind. Without them, the environmental and human cost of this calamity would have been immeasurably greater.” Salgado dedicated his book to the ”fearless men” who risked their lives to end the environmental crisis. He said they came from many different parts of the world, enduring ”unbelievably difficult circumstances” to extinguish the fires and cap the oil wells. His photos show their faces splattered with oil as they scramble to stop gushing wellheads. Nearby, massive walls of fire reach several stories high. Salgado recalls intense heat, toxic fumes and deafening noise. ”By the end of each day, my jaws literally ached from the sheer tension of being exposed for hours on end to heat, noise and oil and to the perennial hazard of a major explosion,” he said. Because many wellheads were damaged, they had to be repaired or replaced, Salgado said. That required metal tools, and when using them there was always the threat of a spark causing another fire. ”It was a bit like trying to put a new faucet on a broken water pipe    without turning off the water,” he said. Salgado remembers seeing workers become dizzy or faint while working in the field. Their colleagues would stop and drag them to safety. ”Here more than ever I saw the importance of both their professionalism and team spirit: the men looked after each other in the knowledge that, if they were in trouble, they too would be cared for,” Salgado said. While Salgado spent each night in a hotel about 30 miles away from the Ahmadi oil fields, the men lived in camps. They used a mixture of gasoline and detergent to wash themselves in their own water lake, the photographer said. Salgado was on assignment for The New York Times Magazine, but many of his photos from Kuwait were never published. Looking through them 25 years later, he felt they had a timeless quality. ”It was a voyage into the past,” he said. ”I relived the moments I took them and I was as moved by what I saw as I had been a quarter of a century earlier.  ”Never before or since have I witnessed an unnatural disaster on such a scale.”"
31715,31750,50516,Turkey: 2 dead in explosion in Izmir,CNN,Madison Park,1/5/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Two people were killed in an explosion Thursday near a courthouse in the city of Izmir in western Turkey, according to the country’s   Anadolu news agency. A police officer and a courthouse staff member died in the attack, the agency said. Nine people were hospitalized with injuries, said Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim.  Police killed two assailants, according to Izmir Gov. Erol Ayyildiz, who blamed the militant Kurdistan Worker’s Party or PKK, for the attack.  So far, there has been no claim of responsibility for the attack.  On Thursday, police had stopped a suspicious vehicle at a checkpoint in front of the courthouse, which led to an armed clash between attackers and security forces, Ayyildiz said. During the clash, the attackers ”detonated a car bomb as they tried to escape,” he told reporters.  The attackers were armed with Kalashnikov rifles and grenades, Ayyildiz said.  Fethi Sekin, a    police officer who had worked at the Izmir courthouse for nine years, noticed the attackers and prevented their car from reaching the entry, the state news agency reported.  He pulled his weapon and chased the attackers as they escaped from the vehicle. He killed one of the attackers, but died during the clash, according to Anadolu.  Turkish officials praised the police for their quick action.  ”Our brave police prevented a disaster,” Yildirim said.  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan tweeted about the two victims saying that he wished ”mercy from Allah to the martyr police officer that prevented a major disaster and the crew member that lost his life.”  Officials: Larger attack may have been planned, Turkey’s Deputy Prime Minister Veysi Kaynak told reporters that weapons found after the explosion suggested a larger attack had been planned.  ”If you look at the preparation, ammunition and guns, you understand that they were targeting a big destruction but it did not happen.” He credited the ”well trained” police and theorized that the PKK or ISIS could have been responsible. At the scene, police defused a ”suspicious car” believed to belong to the attackers in a controlled explosion, according to Anadolu.  Who were the attackers?  In the aftermath of the attack, Anadolu initially reported two suspected attackers were killed and a third was at large, but it’s not clear if there is another suspect. ”There might be or there might not be but because of the possibility we are looking for him, and if there is one, he will be caught,” Ayyildiz told reporters. READ: Why Turkey is such a target for terror, Police detained two people related to the Izmir attack, according to Anadolu. It was unclear if either is the potential suspect at large.  Amid a spate of attacks in Turkey, Erdogan posted on Twitter: ”We will never give in and let terror fear our people, intimidate the country and polarize our society.” The US Embassy in Turkey condemned the attack and vowed to stand with the Turkish people in fighting terror. It tweeted a message that translates to ”sorry for your loss.”  Izmir, a busy port on the Aegean Sea, is Turkey’s   city, home to more than 2 million people. High alert, Turkey is still reeling from the New Year’s attack on an Istanbul nightclub that left 39 people dead. According to Anadolu, at least 69 others were hurt in the shooting rampage. The gunman remains at large. Police have detained 34 suspects, as well as others picked up in raids Thursday, the news agency reported. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement posted to Twitter, but CNN cannot independently verify the claim. The terror group boasted of carrying out the first major terrorist attack of 2017. Growing threat, Earlier this week, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu told lawmakers that Turkish security forces had prevented 339 major terror incidents in 2016, 80 of which came in the final three months of the year. In his speech to Parliament, Soylu cited attacks launched by Daesh, the Arabic term for ISIS, and PKK.  PKK, which is branded a terror group by Turkey, US and EU, has sought an independent state for the Kurdish minority.  Anadolu quoted Soylu as saying that ”313 of the incidents were planned by PKK, 22 by Daesh and four by radical leftist groups.”"
31716,31751,50517,How far will Schumer go over Supreme Court?,CNN,Paul Callan,1/6/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Someone in the Democratic Party should remind Sen. Chuck Schumer of the axiom that ”revenge is a dish best served cold,” because their Senate leader is preparing a piping hot bowl of it in his veiled threat to block consideration of any of Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominees indefinitely. The remarks are clearly meant as an aggressive counterstrike against Republicans who refused to even allow a vote on President Barack Obama’s nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, who the President submitted for Senate approval last March after the death of Antonin Scalia a month earlier. But although the approach Schumer hinted at might be perfectly legal, a petulant Democratic refusal to consider and vote on Supreme Court nominees at the beginning of a newly elected president’s term would violate over a century of legal precedent    and could cause gridlock in the nation’s highest court. Schumer, speaking in an interview with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Tuesday, said: ”It’s hard for me to imagine a nominee that Donald Trump would choose that would get Republican support that we could support.” Asked by Maddow whether he would do his best ”to hold the seat open,” Schumer responded: ”Absolutely.” But while frustration over Garland’s nomination might be understandable, what Schumer suggests    leaving a Supreme Court seat open for four years    would be unprecedented. So far, the longest delay in filling an open Supreme Court seat occurred in the 1840s when, in August 1846, Justice Robert Grier was confirmed to the seat vacated by Justice Henry Baldwin 841 days earlier. That historic delay arose from some particularly bad blood between President John Tyler and a vengeful   Senate that had previously expelled Tyler from its membership ranks. The Whigs rejected all Tyler’s nominees and the open seat was only filled after President James Polk took office in 1845. Such a lengthy delay occurred during an age that makes   senatorial rhetoric appear tepid. (In 1856, for example, an enraged member of the House of Representatives entered the Senate Chamber and proceeded to bludgeon Massachusetts Sen. Charles Sumner into a state of unconsciousness with a   cane). The longest periods a Supreme Court seat has remained unfilled over the past century have been a mere 237 and 391 days. The seat of Justice Abe Fortas remained open for 391 days until it was filled by President Richard Nixon’s nominee, Justice Harry Blackmun in June 1970.  The seat of Lewis Powell was finally filled by President Ronald Reagan’s choice, Justice Anthony Kennedy, in February 1988. Schumer’s startling threat, if achieved, would constitute a delay of 1, 460 days      the ancient Whig record. So how would Schumer pull off a threat of such historic magnitude, especially since Republicans hold a majority of 52 Senate seats? The answer is the filibuster, the ancient Senate rule that permits the blocking of a vote on a Supreme Court nomination unless 60 votes can be mustered to break the filibuster. The Democrats could theoretically gather sufficient votes to block Republicans from reaching the magic 60 vote number. True, in 2013, the filibuster rule was sharply limited by the Democrats, who were tired of Republicans using this procedural device to block their agenda. But   Majority Leader Harry Reid chose to retain the right of filibuster in the case of Supreme Court nominations, while prohibiting use of the procedural device in virtually all other matters. The weapon, therefore, is alive and well for upcoming SCOTUS battles. Of course, the Republicans, if pushed to extreme anger by an intransigent Democrat minority, could invoke the so called ”nuclear option” and finally put a stake through the heart of the filibuster for all time by a simple majority vote on a question of parliamentary procedure. Tradition, though, dies hard in ”the world’s greatest deliberative body.” The good news in all this is that until Scalia’s seat is filled, life will go on, and pretty much no one except the lawyers will even notice that we have eight rather than nine justices on the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court deadlocks   on hot button issues such as abortion, campaign financing and other points of ideological dispute, the ruling of the lower court remains intact and the business of America’s courts will proceed as before. That just leaves the question of how far Schumer and his colleagues are willing to take this. Will the Whig record for SCOTUS obstruction finally be broken? I suspect the senior senator from New York and his Senate colleagues would make a better page in the history books by avoiding obstructionism and instead confirming a justice of intellectual stature, of high ethical standards who is guided by a sense of fairness for all."

And just so we’re on the same page, Fridays are awesome!  I’m Carl Azuz.  We’re happy to have you watching. We’re starting in the Asian country of China, the world’s most populated nation and some parts of it have seen two red alerts already this year.   What is a red alert?  It’s China’s strongest warning about air quality.  One of the recent red alerts was for smog.  In more than 20 Chinese cities, schools were closed earlier this week.  Factories were shut down.  Vehicles that gave off a lot of pollution were banned from the roads.   And then, yesterday, China’s northern and eastern regions received their first ever red alert for fog.  Visibility was severely limited in some areas.  Pilots and sailors were told to be careful.  Drivers were told to slow down. Air pollution is an ongoing problem in many parts of China and it’s usually worse in winter.  Cold air inversions in the atmosphere can trap smog close to the ground, and more coal is burned in cold weather to keep heaters running. A congressional hearing yesterday in Washington, D. C. focused on global cyber threat and almost all of it centered on Russia, which the Obama administration accuses of hacking into American computer systems and interfering in last year’s U. S. election. A Republican senator said, quote, ”Every American should be alarmed by Russia’s attacks on our nation.”  A Russian spokesman said his country was sick and tired of people, quote, ”irresponsibly blaming everything on Russia.”   Taking a look at Russian President Vladimir Putin    what makes him tick? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PHIL BLACK, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT ( ):  Some have believed (ph) Vladimir Putin could be the most powerful man in the world.  Not everyone sees him that way.  But Putin has powerful levers, he’s often willing to use    including cyber power, military might and a cult of personality.  Together, they form an often effective web of influence. While Moscow denies highly skilled hackers tried to influence the U. S. election, they’ve also been accused of spying and causing big disruptions in other countries, like Estonia and Ukraine    claims Russia also rejects.  Russia’s enormous hacking power, state and criminal, isn’t a new.  It traces back to the USSR when its universities were designed to produce world class engineers. Putin’s power is also hugely enhanced by his very personal control of Russia’s vast military, much of it including the nukes, is also a Soviet legacy.  So, Putin is pumping extraordinary amounts of money to modernization, but most analyst agree Russia’s conventional forces are still only mighty enough to project power close to its borders. Russia also used limited air power to successful prop up the Syrian regime.  But critics say that works because of Putin’s willingness to indiscriminately bombard civilian areas, something Moscow denies.   One of the biggest sources of Putin’s power is his own extraordinary popularity at home.  The more other world leaders criticized him, the more Russians celebrate their president.  His approval figure soared with Ukraine and spiked again with Syria.   The reason many Russians really care about their country’s ability to influence world events, even if it comes to sanctions and a hit to their own quality of life.  They’re proud of it.  Putin also benefits from a political system and the media landscape with zero tolerance for criticism.   So, no doubt, Vladimir Putin is powerful and unpredictable, but he’s also limited by some pretty big problems.  The Russian economy isn’t going anywhere.  That’s why there is another popular theory about Putin and his web of influence, as someone who plays a weak hand very well. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AZUZ ( ):    trivia: What do all drone bees have in common?  Are they all males, females, worker bees, or carpenter bees? Well, the queen and worker bees are all females, it’s the drones who are all males. (END VIDEO CLIP) AZUZ:  But bees are disappearing worldwide.  Scientists’ theories as to why include a might that attacks fees, pesticides that kill the insects, habitat loss, and even bad nutrition for bees.  And the cause for concern goes well beyond the collapse of honey bee colonies.  Bees help pollinate 35 percent of the world’s food.   The Franklin’s bumblebee alone would help pollinate cranberries, blueberries and melons.  But that type of bee may already be extinct. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOHN SUTTER, CNN COLUMNIST:  The vacuum on one hand and net in the other, Robbin Thorp (ph) is on a quest. ROBBIN THORP:  So, we’re coming into an area where we last saw Franklin’s. SUTTER:  He’s searching the mountains of Oregon for Franklin’s bumblebee. It’s a species he’s believed to be the last person on earth to have seen alive, and he’s got the sample of the bee in the back of his truck.  It’s from the 1950s. THORP:  And this is Franklin’s.  And you can see, she has a black face, little touch of whitish hair there.  Pretty subtle. SUTTER:  This is a bee that could be extinct in the wild. THORP:  Could be.  I’m not willing to give on it, but I’m hoping it’s still out there under the radar. SUTTER:  The last time he saw it was 2006, exactly ten years before he invited me to join him.  Thorp is 83 now, a retired professor from   and mostly, he works alone, day after day, year after year. I spent two days looking for Franklin’s bumblebee with Thorp.  I found the work absolutely maddening. THORP:  The ones that do here fly by your ear.  I always think, well, that must have been a Franklin’s.  I don’t think you can put an economic value on the species.  They’re all priceless really.  But Franklin’s is one that I’ve got a lot of personal investment in.  And, yes, I feel an attachment in terms of doing it. SUTTER:  I’m not sure whether he’ll find it.  But maybe that’s beside the point.  The truth is that for anyone to know a species like Franklin’s bumblebee had vanished, someone like Thorp has to be looking. (END VIDEOTAPE) AZUZ:  In Atlanta, Georgia, there’s a giant peach that drops on New Year’s Eve.  It’s one of many annual traditions nationwide.  In Wisconsin, there’s a giant cheese drop.   In North Carolina, a possum drop, or at least a possum lowering.  It’s in a box.  It’s not hurt. But the famous drop is probably at New York’s Times Square.  What exactly got this ball rolling? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORTER:  Before we had time zones, each city kept their own time based on the sun.  This was a problem for sailors, whose time pieces often got   at sea. In the early 1800s, an official in the Royal Navy suggested using a visual on shore.  So, they put a ball on top of the flag pole, and raised up a second ball a few minutes before 12:00, when light passed between the two, sailors set their clocks to noon. Eventually, self winding clocks and other new tech made these time balls unnecessary. Fast forward a few years, ”The New York Times” relocates to what is now Times Square.  To celebrate, they decided to throw a party on New Year’s Eve.  Before then, New Yorkers gathered at Trinity Church where people would throw bricks in the air like confetti.  So, ”The Times” opted for fireworks instead.   But a couple of years later, the city banned the display.  Tasked with finding an even safer celebration, the newspaper found inspiration in those old naval time balls.   In 1907, a   ball of wood and iron, outfitted with   light bulbs is lowered to ring in the New Year.  A tradition was born. Since then, we’ve only gone without the ball twice.  That was in 1942, and 1943, when the government was worried the bright lights could be a target during World War II.  So, chimes were used instead. (END VIDEOTAPE) AZUZ:  We’re ”10 out of 10” it’s too bad basketball shots can’t be worth more than three points, because while the Golden State Warriors regularly sink three pointers at Oracle Arena in Oakland, California, a member of the Harlem Globetrotters recently trotted to the roof of the arena itself and took a shot from 100 feet up and 100 feet away.  Swish! Now, it’d be a bad idea to jump up to celebrate and he didn’t do that.  But if your job is trotting the globe, banking on an athlete or a zone to layup a world of hop dream possibilities, fans will raise the roof when you raise up to the roof and sink a shot that’s kind of an air ball and a free throw and a slam dunk all at once. For that, you get 10 points, and we hope you’ll make it a point to join us again Monday when CNN TEN returns.  I’m Carl Azuz.  Have a great weekend, everyone.

31718,31753,50519,Kaine: Why is Trump Putin’s ’defense lawyer’?,CNN,Eugene Scott,1/5/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Sen. Tim Kaine on Thursday criticized   Donald Trump, alleging he is acting like Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ”defense lawyer” and calling Trump’s conduct ”suspicious.”  ”Why does   Trump again and again and again take it upon himself to be Vladimir Putin’s defense lawyer rather than listening to and respecting the intelligence professionals of the United States,” Kaine told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota on ”New Day”  in his first national interview since the 2016 presidential election.   The former Democratic vice presidential nominee, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee which is hold a hearing on hacking Thursday, said that even if Trump believes Russia can be America’s ally in the fight against ISIS, he doesn’t have to ”trash” American intelligence professionals in the process.  ”There is something very unusual    indeed, even sort of suspicious    about the degree to which he casually kicks aside the intelligence community when he won’t even go to the briefings again and again and takes the   Putin line on this important question” about whether Russian was behind the   hacks, Kaine said.  California Rep. Adam Schiff, a member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, said Republicans’ confidence in Assange over the intelligence community is ”embarrassing.”  ”You hear former colleagues like mine, Vice   Mike Pence, tie themselves in knots, or my colleague (California Republican) Darrell Issa, saying they put more faith in an accused sex offender than their own intelligence agencies,” the Democrat told Chris Cuomo on ”New Day.” ”It’s embarrassing to be honest with you,” he added. ”This is not healthy skepticism as they would like to portray it. This is very unhealthy, essentially avoidance of the facts.” Schiff also said he didn’t expect Trump to change his tune after he receives an extensive intel briefing on the hacking on Friday. ”He has been briefed, he knows better,” Schiff said. ”It’s at odds with his own preferred version of events, and he will not accept it.” He added, ”I think it goes back to a very simple thing. It’s not unrelated to Julian Assange. That is during the campaign, WikiLeaks was helpful to him, Assange was helpful to him. During the campaign, the Russian hacks were helpful to him, and Donald Trump does not bite the hand that feeds him.” Donald Trump’s fight with America’s spies, Trump’s ongoing feud with the intelligence community just weeks before his inauguration suggests that there will be unusual tension between the White House and America’s top spies on national security issues. When the   enters office, he would have invested more credibility in the head of Russian and the fugitive who founded WikiLeaks than leading US intelligence agencies.  ”When he’s quoting Julian Assange, who is wanted for sexual assault crimes in Sweden, as some kind of authority on this, that makes me really scratch my head,” Kaine said.  Assange is wanted by Swedish authorities over allegations of sexual assault, and was granted asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in 2012. But Trump pushed back Thursday against the idea that he is in agreement with Assange. ”The dishonest media likes saying that I am in Agreement with Julian Assange   wrong. I simply state what he states, it is for the people,” he tweeted. ”to make up their own minds as to the truth. The media lies to make it look like I am against ”Intelligence” when in fact I am a big fan,” Trump added. The Virginia Democrat also blasted Trump for encouraging Putin to interfere in the 2016 election. During a July speech, Trump said, ”Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30, 000 (Hillary Clinton) emails that are missing.” Kaine believes Russia took the   up on the invitation. ”That’s exactly what happened. We’ve got to get to the bottom of this because we’ve got to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” he said. "
31719,31755,50521,Military welcomes first women infantry Marines,CNN,Sophie Tatum,1/5/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN) An infantry battalion at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina received three historic additions Thursday    the first women infantry Marines.  The three women will serve in the 1st Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, with specializations as rifleman, machine gun and mortar, according to 1st Lt. John McCombs, a Marines spokesman.  The identities of the women are not being released at this time to allow them to get acclimated to their unit, McCombs said. The unit already has three females in leadership roles and they will be able to help with the transition, he noted. Women had not been allowed to participate in certain military roles until Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced that starting in January 2016, the military would be required to open all combat positions to both males and females.   Women have been working to fight alongside men for more than 150 years, according to the US military    going as far back as the Civil War where more than 400 women disguised themselves as men.  As a new administration readies to take over, it is  unclear how Donald Trump will handle the role of women in the military.  In August 2015, Trump told CNN’s Chris Cuomo he would allow women to fight in the military because ”they’re really into it,” but said he would also want to speak to the military about the issue.  Trump tweeted a comment in 2013 that appeared to raise doubts about women serving. ”26, 000 unreported sexual assaults in the   238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men  women together?” Trump wrote. When asked about the remark during a campaign forum in September, Trump stood by it. ”I think that that’s absolutely correct,” Trump told NBC’s Matt Lauer.  Trump clarified that he did not think the solution was to take women out of the equation completely. ”But something has to happen,” Trump said. ”Right now, part of the problem is nobody gets prosecuted. You have reported . .. you have the report of rape and nobody gets prosecuted.” Trump’s nominee for defense secretary, retired Gen. James Mattis, has made comments suggesting he is wary about female integration into infantry and special operations roles where there is what he called ”intimate killing.”  ”When you have to reduce standards    as you would have to do, you would have to do it    and when you would mix, you know, when you mix eros, when you mix affection for one another that could be manifested sexually, I don’t care if you go anywhere in history, you will not find where this has worked. Never has this worked,” Mattis said in 2015.  ”We have had numerous cases where you have put healthy young men and women together and you expect them to act like little saints,” Mattis added.   On Wednesday, Mattis met with New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand to talk about the value of women in the military.  When Gillibrand was asked if she had any policy disagreements with Trump’s nominee, she responded: ”I do have concerns about the role of women in the military and how sexual assault in the military will be addressed, but I’ll ask those questions in the hearing specifically so he can answer them for the record and then make a decision.”  Gillibrand has been a fierce advocate of military sexual assault prevention legislation in Congress and has worked to change how reports of sexual assaults are handled."
31720,31756,50522,Australia and Indonesia: A relationship too important to fail?,CNN,Juliet Perry,1/5/17,2017,1,," (CNN) The sudden   and equally quick detente, between Australia and Indonesia over the past few days shows just how delicate    and crucial    the relationship between the two neighbors is.  Indonesia suspended all military cooperation with Australia last month after taking offense over an incident at a joint military training facility.  There was a twist in the tale however    Australia made a public apology on Thursday and Indonesia accepted it the very same day, downplaying a spat that had earlier seemed to have severe, and potentially   repercussions.  The grace displayed by both nations mended what could have been a very damaging rift.  Natali Sambhi, a research fellow who focuses on Indonesian defense and security at the Perth USAsia Center, tells CNN the defense cooperation between the two countries is mutually beneficial to both militaries. She adds that there are a number of security challenges, including people smuggling and terrorism, where working together is more fruitful than working alone. ”Military exercises and exchanges also help build good working relationships between personnel, which can help open vital channels of communication during times of crisis,” she says. Mathew Davies, the head of the International Relations Department at The Australian National University, says Australia views its relationship with Indonesia as ”centrally important” and warns the connection is still ”delicate”. ”Without Indonesia, all of Australia’s key partner states are a long way away.” ”A strong relationship helps Australia feel ’part of the region’    ensuring that Australian interests are listened to and respected, and that Australia is not isolated.”   relations had been warming prior to the recent kerfuffle Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s leadership led to a thaw with Indonesian President Joko Widodo after a tumultuous few years of relations with Tony Abbott. However, Davies says there remain strong sensitivities on both sides, especially regarding the issue of mutual respect.  ”The continued sensitivity of the Indonesian military illustrates just how hard it is to build lasting trust between the two sides,” he adds. Offense too ’hurtful’ to describe, The military misunderstanding between the neighbors was sparked off when an Indonesian special forces instructor found documents insulting the Pancasila, Indonesia’s national philosophy, at a joint training camp. Indonesian Armed Forces commander Gen. Gatot Nurmantyo said the documents questioned Indonesia’s sovereignty on West Papua and were offensive about Indonesian soldiers who served in East Timor. When asked about the exact contents of the offending material, he refused to elaborate, saying it was ”too hurtful” to say. He said he wanted a personal apology from Australia’s army chief. ”Why should I go to Australia?” he said. ”It should be the other way around.” Whatever they were, the offensive materials led to Indonesia suspending ”defense cooperation,” a stance that changed when Australian Defense Minister Marise Payne expressed regret for any offense caused.   At a press conference Thursday, she promised the offending material had ”most certainly” been removed and that it would be replaced by appropriate material. Her Indonesian counterpart, Ryamizard Ryacudu, accepted her apology. ”Something like this should never happen, because as friendly countries, we are not supposed to let this kind of incident ruin our friendship,” he said. He added the only halt in joint activities was in language training, while a ”complete investigation” is done.  Joko himself addressed the issue on Thursday, saying the situation had to be dealt with so it didn’t get any ”hotter.”  ”I think our relationship with Australia is still in a good condition,” he added. A long and tempestuous relationship, The occasionally rocky relationship between Australia and Indonesia has steadily improved since the late 1990s, when Australia led an international peacekeeping task force into the then Indonesian territory of East Timor. Cooperation between the two nations was spurred on by joint security efforts to fight regional terrorism in the wake of the 2002 Bali bombings and subsequent attacks in Jakarta, including the bombing of the Australian Embassy there. In 2009, it was revealed that Australian intelligence attempted to tap the mobile phone of   Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. And in 2015, Indonesia executed two Australian prisoners in Bali, which led to Australia recalling its ambassador."
31721,31757,50523,Why protests are erupting in Mexico,CNN,Catherine E. Shoichet,1/5/17,2017,1,," (CNN) A hefty government gas price hike is fueling protests, looting and road blockades in Mexico. Authorities arrested more than 250 people for robbery and acts of vandalism around the country this week, officials said. Some protests have been peaceful. But in other parts of the country, people ransacked stores. Elsewhere, they clamored to get gas. Officials announced in December that they were planning to increase gas prices, in some cases more than 20%. President Enrique Peña Nieto says the increase is a ”responsible measure for the stability of the economy.” Some protesters say their frustration with the government is about much more than sticker shock. Peña Nieto has faced criticism for his handling of the country’s drug war, alleged corruption in his administration and his decision to meet with Donald Trump during the US presidential campaign. Mexico’s ’contingency plan’ against Trump isn’t working, This is a time of year when Mexicans normally gear up to celebrate Three Kings Day, when children traditionally receive holiday gifts. But the sudden gas price hike is dampening the mood in a country where the economy is already struggling. The Mexican peso    riding a tough year in 2016    plummeted after Trump’s election. "
31722,31758,50524,Attack a reminder of violence faced by disabled,CNN,,1/5/17,2017,1,," (CNN) It’s a horrific incident. On Tuesday afternoon, Chicago police found a young man wearing shorts, wandering the streets, clearly in distress. They matched him to a missing persons call from a nearby suburb. Over the next day, gruesome details emerged of what had happened to the    mentally disabled male. According to police, the young man was kidnapped and tortured, his abuse streamed live over Facebook. The alleged assailants are black, and at one point on the video, a male voice can be heard yelling, ””f*ck Donald Trump” and ”f*ck white people.” Four individuals have been charged. The racist comments are inflammatory. People    via both formal and social media    have expressed outrage. But while the nature of the remarks on the video have unsurprisingly sparked much discussion about race, Trump and the live streaming of crimes, something important risks being overlooked: the chilling, everyday, truth that to be disabled in America is to be at greater risk of violence. According to CNN, local law enforcement officials have charged the four suspects with a ”hate crime, felony aggravated kidnapping, aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.” But much of the speculation over whether this was a hate crime has focused on the issue of race. People with disabilities are, of course, protected under both federal and Illinois hate crime legislation. To qualify under current federal law, according to Samuel Bagenstos, a law professor at the University of Michigan and former Department of Justice official, the crime must involve interstate commerce in some way. He told me that broadcasting over Facebook Live might make such a prosecution possible.  The Illinois statute, for its part, defines a hate crime as a criminal act against someone ”by reason of the actual or perceived race, color, creed, religion, ancestry, gender, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability, or national origin of another individual or group of individuals, regardless of the existence of any other motivating factor or factors.” If the victim was singled out for his disability, that should be reason enough in Illinois. In fact, people with disabilities are often victims of violent crime. The latest Bureau of Justice Statistics report shows that people with disabilities were 2. 5 times more likely to experience violent victimization than people without disabilities. Moreover, disability is an intensifying factor when it comes to understanding how   groups experience violence.  Lydia Brown, a disabled writer, organizer and educator, has looked at the use of hate crime legislation in cases involving disabilities.   states have hate crimes laws listing disability to some degree, but that doesn’t mean they are actually using the laws actively in   crimes. And while Brown is concerned about mass incarceration, violence against disabled people should still be handled equitably. ”When someone kills disabled people, it’s usually not given the same degree of seriousness of zeal in prosecution as when the victim is not disabled,” Brown said. ”That doesn’t mean the solution is to lock up more people, but it does mean society does not treat ableist violence as seriously.” I spoke to Rebecca Cokley, executive director of the National Council on Disability, about the problem. ”Violence against people with disabilities is a national problem, regardless of Zip Code,” she said, adding that we can only address such violence by engaging the many ways that stigma and discrimination against disabled people (ableism) intersect with other forms of hate like racism, sexism, or homophobia.   ”The voices of disabled people must be centered in justice reform. Complex problems require comprehensive solutions,” she said. Unfortunately, the general public    and even many disabled people    aren’t focused on this issue. Amber Smock, director of advocacy at Access Living, a Chicago based disability rights and services organization, told me: ”The public tends to be unaware that people with disabilities have rights as a protected class against hate crimes. We deserve that recognition as a protected class. We believe that many people with disabilities themselves need to know that they, too, can fight back against hate crimes.” But fighting back takes allies in the legal system. They can be hard to find. Indeed, over the past year, I’ve been following a case in Idaho where a black, disabled teen was allegedly lured into the locker room by three white teammates from the football team. Court reports say he was grabbed and anally raped with a coat hanger.   The local prosecutor, however, declined to press hate crime or sex crime charges, instead accepting a guilty plea to a lesser felony of ”injury to a child,” which will carry no jail time. ”It’s not our belief that this was a racially motivated crime. This was more of a   motivated crime,” the prosecutor said. ”I think it probably would have happened to anybody that was in the same kind of circumstances and mental state as the victim here.”  In other words, because the victim was attacked due to his disability, the crime isn’t being treated as seriously.  Kidnappings and torture matched with inflammatory racist statements that are broadcast on Facebook Live are rare. But the reality is that violence against people with disabilities is all too common. We need a legal system and a society that recognizes the vulnerability    and shared humanity    of all disabled people. "
31723,31760,50526,"Fort Lauderdale airport: 5 dead, shooting suspect had gun in checked bag",CNN,Catherine E. Shoichet,1/6/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Esteban Santiago went to baggage claim and picked up his one piece of checked luggage.  There were no other bags, just a case with a handgun inside.     Santiago allegedly took the 9 mm handgun out of its case and fired at other travelers Friday afternoon, killing five people at the Fort Lauderdale airport. On Saturday, authorities revised the number of wounded to six after earlier saying eight. A few months earlier he reportedly had a mental evaluation after a bizarre visit to an FBI office in Alaska. Friday’s shooting sent the airport terminal into chaos, with people running for cover. They started running again when rumors of more gunshots and a possible second shooter spread through the busy airport. Almost 40 others would get hurt in the rushed evacuation after the attack. Some suffered sprains and bruises others had broken bones.  Here’s what we know about the deadly shooting and what officials have said about the suspect:  Who is Esteban Santiago? Law enforcement officials identified Esteban Santiago, 26, as the suspect in the five deaths at Fort   International Airport. Santiago didn’t resist when he was taken into custody, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said. According to his booking information, Santiago is being held without bond on a murder charge. He lives in Alaska, where he was a security guard.  Alaska was also the site of his last military assignment. He was a member of the Alaska Army National Guard from November 2014 until August when he was discharged for unsatisfactory performance, a spokeswoman for the guard said. In November, Santiago paid a visit to the FBI office in Anchorage, telling agents he was hearing voices and being directed by a US intelligence agency to watch ISIS videos, law enforcement sources told CNN. George Piro, the FBI’s special agent in charge in Miami, told reporters that Santiago was turned over to local authorities and he voluntarily submitted to a mental health evaluation.  ”His erratic behavior concerned FBI agents,” Piro said Saturday.  The military said Santiago’s nine years of service in the National Guard included one   tour of Iraq, where he was awarded a combat action badge.  Santiago returned from Iraq a changed man, his aunt told CNN on Saturday.  ”His mind was not right,” the aunt, Maria Ruiz Rivera, said in a phone interview in Spanish from her home in New Jersey. ”He seemed normal at times, but other times he seemed lost. He changed.” She added, ”He talked about all the destruction and the killing of children. He had visions all the time.” Ruiz said she lost contact with Santiago several months ago. ”He stopped calling,” she said. ”He wouldn’t respond to my messages. I would call and text. He seemed distant.” Her family is still in shock.  ”Who would have imagined that he could do something like this?” she said. ”I don’t say that because we’re family. I say it because he wasn’t like that.” How did he get to Fort Lauderdale? Piro said Santiago flew from Anchorage to Minneapolis to Fort Lauderdale on a Delta Air Lines flight.  A lieutenant with the Anchorage airport police said Santiago had one bag    a handgun case with a pistol inside that he checked.  Authorities do not know why Santiago was in Fort Lauderdale.  But Piro said Saturday that Santiago ”came here specifically to carry out this horrific attack.”   ”We have not identified any triggers that would have caused this attack,” he said. Piro said investigators were looking at airport video to see how the rampage unfolded. Authorities have conducted more than 100 interviews as part of their investigation.  What was the motive? The FBI has not ruled out terrorism, Piro said, but Israel cautioned it was early in the investigation and authorities did not know Santiago’s motive. On Saturday, Piro said investigators ”continue to look at the terrorism angle” as a possible motive.  ”We have not ruled out anything,” he said. ”We continue to look at all avenues, all motives.”  Piro said Santiago was cooperating with investigators, who had interviewed him for several hours. The interview concluded early Saturday.  There were reports of a possible altercation involving Santiago on the flight to Fort Lauderdale, but law enforcement sources said investigators haven’t discovered any evidence to support those claims. The airline said it had received no reports of any incidents during the flight. ”Reports from customers and crew onboard the flight in question indicate that there was not a customer altercation during the flight,” according to a Delta representative. What was it like at the airport?  Sara Graham, who had been vacationing in Fort Lauderdale, wrote on Instagram that she and her family were about 100 feet away from the shooter. Graham said her brother led her and her mother to safety after the commotion began.  ”When we first heard the shots we had no idea what was happening until everyone started running towards exits,” she wrote. ”We hid for about 30 minutes and we’re let back inside, under the impression it was all safe.” Then there was a rumor of another shooter and people started running again.  ”Once we were outside, we had to run three more times until we were sure that we were safe,” she said. They spent the rest of Friday afternoon in an aircraft hangar before people were allowed to leave.  One man told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that a laptop in a backpack he had slung over his shoulder stopped a bullet that could have killed him. ”I felt something hit my back,” Steve Frappier said, adding he thought it was luggage falling off the carousel.  It was a bullet, which ricocheted off the laptop. He found it in the side pocket of his bag. Other witnesses described the aftermath of the shooting as a ”war zone” and ”mass hysteria.”  What are rules for firearms in   bags? Taking a gun on a plane is legal if a passenger brings the weapon in a case that locks and checks the suitcase containing the gun.  The gun cannot be loaded, though regulations allow travelers who fill out a declaration form to also bring ammunition. Florida law prohibits guns inside terminals unless they are still in their case, but there is a bill before the state Legislature to allow guns in public places such as airports. How was air traffic affected? The Fort Lauderdale airport was closed for the rest of Friday, and more than 10, 000 travelers had their trips interrupted for hours.  Flight tracking website FlightAware said 159 arrivals and 149 departures were canceled    about a third of the scheduled flights.  The airport said services resumed Saturday.  Roads reopened Saturday morning for passengers and airport employees to reach the airport, according to its Twitter feed. Passengers were advised to check with their airline before traveling. The airport said earlier it was collecting and processing more than 20, 000 bags and personal items left behind during the evacuation to return them to their owners. About 10, 000 passengers were taken Friday by bus from the airport to a terminal at Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, officials said.   Some people were forced to remain on planes that landed but weren’t allowed to reach their gates. One JetBlue passenger said he was stuck for six hours. "
31724,31761,50527,Shooting raises questions about the limits of flying with firearms,CNN,,1/7/17,2017,1,," (CNN) The shooting Friday at Fort   International Airport may test the bounds of something that is entirely legal and commonplace in the United States: Flying with a gun and ammunition. The incident highlights the peculiarities and seeming contradictions of local, state and federal gun laws inside the nation’s airports: It is legal for a passenger to travel with a firearm and ammunition in checked baggage, but inside baggage claim or at a ticketing counter, that person might otherwise be breaking the law if the weapon is out in the open or carried on their person. Five people were shot dead and eight wounded in a baggage claim area at Florida’s   airport, and law enforcement sources tell CNN the suspect had legally brought the firearm and ammunition in his checked baggage while flying from Anchorage to Fort Lauderdale. When he reached his destination, the suspect went to baggage claim, got his baggage, took out the gun and began firing, sources told CNN.  Airport officials say that Friday’s incident could ignite a debate about the limits of traveling with firearms, as the shooting revealed a security vulnerability in transportation security policies, but also the   of securing areas where the public is free to come and go. Transportation Security Administration rules permit unloaded firearms and ammunition to be transported as checked baggage. The unloaded firearms, ammunition and other firearm parts such as magazines must be declared at   and packed in a locked and hardened case. A feature of TSA’s social media outreach includes showing photos of confiscated weapons, but they are typically ones found in   luggage during screening at security checkpoints. Alaska law allows firearms in airport terminals and parking lots, but prohibits them in secure areas of airports. Florida law, by contrast, prohibits them inside airport terminals, unless they’re encased for shipment. The Florida Legislature next week was scheduled to debate a bill that would allow firearms to be carried at, among other public places, airports. Shootings at airports have accounted for a tiny fraction of the    mass shootings in the U. S. but have garnered high visibility due to the extensive security that surrounds the aviation system globally. The debate over how to secure airports has been happening at airports around the world.    people were killed in March 2016 at Brussels Airport in the Belgian capital after suicide bombers detonated explosives at a ticketing and   area, shutting down the airport for 12 days, and at a train station. An attack at Ataturk Airport in Istanbul in June killed 45 and injured hundreds more. In the United States, a Southwest Airlines employee was shot and killed following a shooting in November at Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City. A TSA officer was killed in November 2013 when a gunman opened fire at a security checkpoint at Los Angeles International Airport. "
31725,31762,50528,’The backpack saved my life’ ,CNN,,1/7/17,2017,1,," (CNN) An eyewitness and near victim of the shooting at the Fort Lauderdale airport described how his backpack and laptop may have spared his life from the gunman’s rampage Friday afternoon. ”The backpack saved my life,” Steve Frappier said, speaking on CNN’s ”AC360.” ”[I] dropped and the backpack was still on my back and I was turned in such a way where that at one point when the shooter shot toward my direction . .. there was a bullet that ricocheted.” Frappier went on to describe the frenetic scene in which he said he was sheltered on the ground ”like a tortoise with the backpack on me” when the gunman’s bullet struck.   ”I felt something hit my back,” he said speaking to CNN’s Anderson Cooper. ”It was only later when I went to the bathroom to check myself out that the bullet had entered my backpack, hit my laptop and then later when I gave my backpack over to the FBI for investigation they found the bullet in the pocket of my backpack.”  ”That’s incredible,” replied Cooper. ”So your laptop saved your life? The laptop stopped the bullet.” ”The way that it ricocheted and entered my bag. That would have been my back,” agreed Frappier. Frappier said he had quickly stuffed his laptop into his bag, leaving it open while disembarking from his flight earlier. ”It hit just so through the open backpack, exited, ran through the laptop and the casing and landed in an interior pocket of the backpack,” he said.  Frappier also described an individual who ”saved many of us” in the aftermath of the shooting, warning fellow passengers that the gunman could still be on the loose. Mark Lea, another eyewitness to the shooting, provided more details saying the shooting had lasted about 45 seconds before the gunman laid down and silently waited to be taken in by authorities.  Five people were shot dead and eight wounded in the attack, which took place in the the baggage claim area at Terminal 2 of Fort Lauderdale’s airport. Officials have told CNN that the suspect, Esteban Santiago, carried his firearm in his checked luggage before he began firing.  Authorities also told CNN said it was still too early to understand the suspect’s motivation. He was taken into custody without incident. "
31726,31763,50529,Mexico’s Fox trolls Trump: ’Are you a legitimate president?’,CNN,Daniella Diaz,1/7/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN) Former Mexican President Vicente Fox is back to trolling Donald Trump on Twitter, particularly as the US   has waffled on his pledge to have Mexico pay for a border wall and amid questions about Russian interference in the election. ”Sr Trump, the intelligence report is devastating. Losing election by more than 3M votes and in addition this. Are you a legitimate president?” Fox tweeted Friday night. Fox’s jab at Trump comes after the US intelligence community concluded in a declassified report released that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an ”influence campaign” aimed at hurting Hillary Clinton and helping Trump. Trump downplays Russian meddling in election despite intel report, In addition to that, Trump lost the popular vote to Clinton by 2. 9 million votes    not more than 3 million votes, as Fox said in his tweet    which has been something of a touchy subject for Trump, who has cited his Electoral College lead to highlight his win. Fox also slammed Trump after he said that he is planning to have Mexico reimburse US taxpayers for his campaign promise to build a border wall between the US and Mexico. Fox tweeted, ”TRUMP,  when will you understand that I am not paying for that        wall. Be clear with US tax payers. They will pay for it.” And on Thursday, Fox tweeted, ”Trump may ask whoever he wants, but still neither myself nor Mexico are going to pay for his racist monument. Another promise he can’t keep.” Trump is still insisting that Mexico will ultimately pay billions for the construction of a massive wall along the southern border. Fox was not the only former Mexican president tweeting at Trump on Friday. Felipe Calderon tweeted, ”To @realDonaldTrump : The more jobs you destroy in México, the more immigrants the American people will have. Think a little!” Trump’s transition team did not immediately respond to CNN for a request to comment on the tweets. Fox was one of Trump’s harshest critics during the 2016 election. During Trump’s campaign, he called him a ”false prophet” and said the   nominee heralded the return ”to the era of the ugly American” during an interview in May.  And most famously, Fox cursed on live television in February while talking about Trump and his proposed border wall, telling Fox Business, ”I’m not going to pay for that     wall.”"
31727,31764,50530,Republicans face stumbling blocks on Obamacare repeal,CNN,Tal Kopan,1/6/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN) Republicans are unanimous in their desire to ”repeal and replace” President Barack Obama’s signature health care law    but they are already flirting with not having the 50 votes needed to pass the bill in the Senate.  Republicans have 52 seats in the Senate, meaning they can only afford to lose three members of their caucus before they cannot pass legislation without Democratic votes. (In the case of a   tie, the vice president casts the tie breaker    presumably in favor of the GOP side.) While only one Republican    Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul    has thus far signaled he might vote no on the Obamacare repeal mechanism currently moving through the Senate, potential flashpoints have already emerged that could jeopardize further votes.  House Speaker Paul Ryan’s support of using the Obamacare repeal measure to strip federal funding for Planned Parenthood, an organization that provides abortions as part of its broader reproductive health care services to men and women, could cost the GOP two key votes. That measure would likely pass in the House, but two   rights GOP senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, won’t commit to approving the bill with the Planned Parenthood provision in it.  ”I’m going to wait and see what happens,” Collins told reporters on Thursday, indicating she thinks it’s too early to decide how she will vote on the bill. ”Obviously, I’m not happy to hear the speaker wants to include defunding of Planned Parenthood, an extremely controversial issue in the package.” Murkowski has said this week she won’t ”speculate” about how she may vote on a hypothetical repeal package. When asked her position Thursday, Murkowski’s spokeswoman Karina Petersen said the senator ”is concerned about defunding Planned Parenthood as she is a longtime support of Planned Parenthood and has opposed broadly defunding the organization.” Paul has already voted against moving forward on the measure, which repeals Obamacare through a procedure called budget reconciliation. By voting on Obamacare through the budget process, the Senate can clear the measure with a simply majority    meaning they theoretically need no Democratic votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act.  The   Kentucky Republican has spoken out against the measure, however, because he says it would increase deficit spending and doesn’t balance the budget. He’s already trying to rally his colleagues and members of the budget hawkish House Freedom Caucus to join him, though he hasn’t found any takers yet.  Efforts to defund Planned Parenthood threaten Obamacare repeal, Instead, Paul wants to replace Obamacare on the same day Republicans repeal the law. He tweeted Friday that night that he had spoken with Trump, who he said ”fully supports” the proposal. Repeal and wait on replace, The GOP may face a further internal debate over the ”replace” piece of the puzzle.  While many Republicans support using budget reconciliation to repeal Obamacare, which is possible due to the tax and   elements of Obamacare, they cannot use the tactic to replace the bill. Senators flex muscle with   majority, Many Republicans have favored a plan to repeal the bill early in the Trump administration and then take time to come up with a plan to replace it.   On Thursday, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said that he would be against a ”comprehensive” bill, and would support instead smaller measures to replace it.  But Paul has been joined by Sen. Tom Cotton, of Arkansas in supporting a repeal with an immediate replacement.  ”I think when we repeal Obamacare we need to have the solution in place moving forward,” the Arkansas Republican told MSNBC’s Chuck Todd Thursday. ”I don’t think we can just repeal Obamacare and say we’re going to get the answer two years from now. This is a very complicated problem.” Trump himself has also spoken in favor of immediate replacement    though it’s unclear if he was referring to when the replacement would take effect or when it should be passed. As insurance providers have already set their policies for the coming year, the repeal would not affect Americans this year regardless of when it was passed.  ”No, we’re going to do it simultaneously. It’ll be just fine,” Trump told CBS’ ”60 Minutes” in November when asked if there would be any gap in coverage. ”We’re not going to have, like, a   period and we’re not going to have a   period where there’s nothing. It will be repealed and replaced.” "

But Bryan Santiago said his brother didn’t get the help he needed. Esteban Santiago’s aunt said her nephew talked about the destruction he witnessed. About the killing of children. Visions that haunted him.  ”His mind was not right,” Maria Ruiz Rivera told CNN in a phone interview from her home in New Jersey. ”He seemed normal at times, but other times he seemed lost. He changed.”  Bryan Santiago, who lives in Puerto Rico, said his brother asked authorities for help.  ”And they did nothing. They had him hospitalized for four days, and then they let him go. How are you going to let someone leave a psychological center after four days when he is saying that he is hearing voices?” Esteban Santiago is suspected of killing five people Friday at Florida’s Fort   International Airport, authorities have said.  Relatives said he had been different since his tour in Iraq, where he was deployed with the Puerto Rico National Guard from April 2010 to February 2011. ’He had visions all the time’ ”He talked about all the destruction and the killing of children. He had visions all the time,” said Ruiz, speaking in Spanish during the interview.  Bryan Santiago said he believes the shooting rampage resulted from mental issues that appeared after Iraq.  Bryan Santiago, in an interview in Peñuelas, Puerto Rico, said he talked with people who know his brother and they told him he didn’t get the treatment he needed.  The Santiago brothers hadn’t talked lately, Bryan said.  Ruiz said she also lost contact with her nephew. ”He stopped calling,” she said. ”He wouldn’t respond to my messages. I would call and text. He seemed distant.”    On Friday, Ruiz said she heard her nephew’s name during a TV news report on the Fort Lauderdale shooting.  ”Who would have imagined that he could do something like this?” she said. ”I don’t say that because we’re family. I say it because he wasn’t like that.” Argument with girlfriend leads to charges  In January 2016, Esteban Santiago was arrested and charged with assault and criminal mischief after an argument with his girlfriend in Anchorage, Alaska, according to court documents that CNN obtained.  At the time, Santiago allegedly yelled at his girlfriend while she was in the bathroom, according to the complaint. He then broke down the bathroom door.   The woman told investigators that Santiago strangled her and struck her in the side of the head, the complaint said. Santiago left before police arrived.  Anchorage municipal prosecutor Seneca Theno said Santiago pleaded no contest to criminal mischief and assault charges. Under a deferred prosecution agreement, the charges would have been dismissed if he complied with the conditions. He was due back in court on March 28.  His record included two earlier minor offenses: no proof of insurance and a taillight violation in 2015. Santiago was employed by an Anchorage security company, a law enforcement official said. Ruiz said her nephew lived with his girlfriend and their child.   Hearing voices, Several months ago, Santiago’s strange behavior came to the attention of agents at the FBI’s Anchorage office. The suspect allegedly told authorities at the time that an intelligence agency was telling him to watch ISIS videos, according to law enforcement officials. Santiago brought a loaded pistol magazine into the FBI office, Anchorage Police Chief Chris Tolley said. He left his gun and child in the car. Police called the girlfriend to pick up the child and kept the pistol for safekeeping, Tolley said.   Marlin Ritzman, who heads the FBI office in Anchorage, said the FBI looked into Santiago’s background and found no ties to terrorism. The FBI asked police to take Santiago to get a mental health evaluation and Santiago voluntarily checked himself in. ”His erratic behavior concerned FBI agents,” George Piro, the FBI’s special agent in charge in Miami, said Saturday.  Anchorage police returned the gun when Santiago came to the police station in December to get it, Tolley said.  Investigators believe it was the same gun that was found at the scene of Friday’s shooting, law enforcement sources told CNN. Emerged from the airport bathroom shooting, Santiago flew to Florida on a Delta Air Lines flight from Alaska via Minnesota, officials said. He had declared his handgun in a firearms carrying case, a lieutenant with the Anchorage airport police said. At the Fort Lauderdale airport, he picked up the carrying case at baggage claim, went into a bathroom stall and loaded a magazine, according to a federal criminal complain citing three crimes he is alleged to have committed. Authorities are still trying to figure out why Santiago shot and killed five people. Piro said Saturday that investigators ”continue to look at the terrorism angle” as a possible motive.  ”We have not ruled out anything,” he said. ”We continue to look at all avenues, all motives.”  Santiago was cooperating with investigators, who had interviewed him for several hours, according to Piro. The interview concluded early Saturday.  Santiago is in federal custody and will appear Monday in court in Broward County, officials said.  The three federal charges have the death penalty as the maximum sentence, if Santiago is convicted. It is unclear whether he has an attorney. Discharge for unsatisfactory performance, Santiago joined the Puerto Rico National Guard in December 2007, said Lt. Col. Candis Olmstead of the Alaska Army National Guard.  After service in Iraq from April 2010 to February 2011, Santiago received the Iraq Campaign Medal with a campaign star, a   honor, CNN’s Barbara Starr reported.  He served in the US Army Reserve before joining the Alaska Army National Guard in November 2014, Olmstead said. The suspect was later given a general discharge from the Alaska Army National Guard in August for unsatisfactory performance. Santiago was not on the radar for possible terrorism ties, according to a law enforcement official and a Department of Homeland Security official. He had no significant foreign travel that was ever flagged, another official said.  "
31729,31766,50532,Facebook Live is the new key witness to crime,CNN,Danny Cevallos,1/7/17,2017,1,," (CNN) The torture of a   teen that was streamed on Facebook Live has raised new questions about the use of social media platforms to spread videos glorifying abuse and humiliation.  This tragic incident might cause some to demand that social media companies such as Facebook do more to police and prevent this kind of content being posted by users.   That would be a mistake.   As a society interested in retributive justice, the last thing we want to do is point the finger at social media. Quite the contrary we should be thrilled that there are outlets like Facebook and Snapchat enticing criminals to post conclusive evidence of their own crimes.   Facebook agrees with me too, though, officially, their position is that they ”prohibit content deemed to be directly harmful. ..” and they ”work hard to remove hate speech quickly.”  What Facebook would really like to say is probably more like: ”Uh, our entire business model is premised on letting any one of our nearly two billion members post anything they want, anytime. What did you expect was going to happen?”   If you think social media platforms should be liable for the postings of others, that’s an understandable sentiment.  It’s just not the law in the United States.   The Communications Decency Act immunizes ”interactive computer services providers” such as Facebook from liability for what others post, even if the social media sites have been notified about damaging material and fail to remove it.  It’s nice that Facebook makes some effort to police these videos, but how could they do more? Social media can never 100% screen all content before it’s uploaded. Maybe in the future that kind of intelligent software will exist, but it doesn’t right now.    You know who else doesn’t want Facebook to do more to prevent these videos? Police and district attorneys. They love social media. I’ve seen it plenty of times in delinquency court. It’s a lot easier to prosecute a guns and drugs case against a juvenile when the juvenile’s own social media postings show him playing with . .. guns and drugs.   Detectives will tell you Facebook is often one of the first places they look for evidence. Sometimes, these cases would be completely unwinnable for the state if not for the defendant providing all the incriminating evidence against himself on social media.   This case in Chicago is a perfect example. So far, it seems that without Facebook Live there might never have been a criminal case to begin with. Even if this disabled victim had identified his assailants to police, if he was the sole eyewitness to this event, without the video, a defense attorney might have picked the victim apart on   and raised reasonable doubt. Instead, this video    produced and published by the defendants alone    will likely singlehandedly convict them, with the added bonus of giving a judge plenty of support for ”maxing them out” at sentencing, too.   On the other hand, there’s the argument that this crime might not have been committed in the first place if not for the allure of Facebook Live viral fame    but that’s a stretch. People have been abusing vulnerable populations for millennia, eons before Facebook and Snapchat.  At least now, social media yields evidence of these crimes, often supplied by the   criminals themselves. Social media shouldn’t aim to prevent disturbing videos like this from being posted. Even if they wanted to, they couldn’t anyway. When people post this kind of content, they only help law enforcement update their ”status” from citizen, to defendant and, ultimately, convicted criminal. And that deserves a big ”like.” "
31730,31767,50533,Thirsty at Trump’s DC hotel bar? Get ready for a yuge bill,CNN,Betsy Klein,1/7/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN) To drink at Donald Trump’s DC hotel lobby bar, The Benjamin, having the  ’s wallet would be helpful.  The bar at Trump International Hotel has recently increased its signature cocktail prices    a lot. The least expensive drink, the   ”Romanesque Revival,” costs $24, while the bar’s namesake cocktail, comprised of rye, vodka, raw Kumamoto oysters and Royal Ossetra caviar, goes for $100.  A previous version of the bar menu, tweeted in September, shows ”Romanesque Revival” at $20, and other cocktails from $16 to $21    hardly a bargain, but certainly more affordable. Looking for something more reasonable? A bottled Bud Light runs $8, a glass of milk $6.  A representative for Trump International Hotel did not immediately respond to request for comment on the new prices.  The price hike was first reported by Washingtonian, which also notes it’s the second time the bar has raised its prices since its soft open in September.  But The Benjamin is crafting more than luxury cocktails    it caters a full experience for visitors, locals and hotel guests and curious tourists alike. Ladies in fur coats and businessmen sip in the palatial lobby of the   Old Post Office building, decked with chandeliers, marble floors, a display of televisions tuned to ESPN, Bloomberg and Fox News, an impressive collection of crystal decanters lining the walls, and contemporary jams pumping through the Bose sound system.  Servers don white gloves to facilitate tastings of wine ”by the crystal spoon,” poured out in   portions, and sipped through the handle, per Hungarian tradition. The least expensive option runs $15 for the ounce.  For a more festive evening, bartenders will roll up a cart of champagne and teach guests to saber the lid with a large knife. Once appropriately taught how to make a clean cut, and ensuring no one is within a particular radius, a loud bell is rung to draw attention to the  . Up slides the knife, pop goes the lid, and the whole bar cheers. The cheapest champagne option is $159, but sabering is free, and guests can keep the glass top. Not surprisingly, there are no happy hour drink specials. But early birds can get half off ”grilled country bread” appetizers from 4 to 6 p. m.  Pricing and vacancy rates for the hotel, which Trump officially opened less than two weeks before the election, indicated the hotel may have initially been slow to book. In   a CNNMoney report found rooms at $505 a night, well pricier than comparable competitors. However, those numbers aren’t always a perfect indicator, and Mickael Damelincourt, the property’s managing director, said it was the most successful opening he’s seen in 10 years working for Trump hotels. Since the grand opening and Trump’s November win, the hotel’s profile has been raised considerably, with new questions as to how the new administration will handle potential conflicts of interest if foreign leaders stay at the hotel as a way of ingratiating themselves with the highest levels of the American government. But on a recent weeknight, the bustling lobby bar showed no signs of slowing. When The Benjamin bill comes, be prepared to lay out the Benjamins. "
31731,31768,50534,South hunkers down for winter storm ,CNN,Judson Jones,1/6/17,2017,1,,"Atlanta (CNN) A messy mix of snow, sleet, ice and rain is expected to blanket much of the Southeastern United States as a winter storm sweeps through the region. The National Weather Service has issued winter storm advisories, watches   warnings that stretch from Arizona to Delaware to the Carolinas    including the metro areas of Atlanta Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina Birmingham, Alabama Greenville, South Carolina and Norfolk and Richmond, Virginia. A winter storm watch means there is potential for significant snow, sleet or ice accumulations that may affect travel.  As of early Friday night, snow had fallen in Raleigh Memphis, Tennessee Tuscaloosa, Alabama and the northern Atlanta suburbs. ”The heaviest snowfall (is) expected to fall from the southern Appalachians to southeastern Virginia,” the National Weather Service said, adding that ”most precipitation will begin to taper off by Saturday evening.” Georgia, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency due to the threat of severe winter weather. CNN meteorologists forecast 3 to 5 inches of snow or more is likely to fall in metro Atlanta. The National Weather Service said overnight snow and sleet accumulation of 2 to 4 inches was possible in Atlanta. ”This is a very serious weather event,” Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said at a news conference. ”My only concern is that I don’t think people have an appreciation for the gravity of it. This is a very, very, significant storm.” Atlanta schools let out two hours early Georgia state offices closed earlier than normal on a staggered schedule.  Crowds flocked to grocery stores to load up on bread, milk and other items in advance of the winter weather.   Still, others were skeptical. Alex Preston posted a photo of long lines on Instagram. ”Because of a snow flurry . .. really?” Preston’s post said. Ice might become more of a factor than accumulations of snow in parts of the metropolitan Atlanta area through Saturday afternoon, according to CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam. ”The ice seems to be having a hard time transitioning into snow,” he said. The best news about the storm is that it will happen on the weekend, which should prevent another ”snow jam” scenario such as the one that paralyzed Atlanta in January 2014. During that storm tens of thousands of weekday commuters left work around the same time, creating massive gridlock on roads and highways and stranding vehicles for hours. What other cities can learn from Atlanta’s ice debacle, Carolinas  The heaviest snow is expected in the Carolinas, where a winter storm morning is in effect from 7 p. m. Saturday to 1 p. m. Sunday.  Raleigh is likely to face the brunt of the storm, according to the National Weather Service. The North Carolina capital could get up to a foot of snow, making it one of the top five snowstorms in the city’s history.  Charlotte may see some 8 inches of snow, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said.  Gov. Roy Cooper has declared a state of emergency for all 100 counties. The National Guard is ready, and the North Carolina Highway Patrol has been mobilized, Cooper said. ”It looks more and more as if this will be a significant snow event in North Carolina, so we are asking people to stay off the road when this weather event begins, and also to stay off the road when it ends,” he said. Cooper urged residents not to call 911 to ask about weather conditions.  He said his inaugural event, originally scheduled for Saturday morning, had been canceled but a smaller   ceremony will be held Friday afternoon at the Governor’s Mansion.   CNN affiliate   in Charlotte posted images of bread and milk being cleaned off shelves at a grocery store. Asheville, in the mountains, expected   inches of snow on Friday, the weather service predicted. The Asheville Airport canceled all departing flights. Alabama, In Birmingham, the storm was expected to begin earlier Friday, most likely as a wintry mix of snow and sleet. There is a chance the air will remain just warm enough in places farther south that the precipitation will fall as sleet. Gov. Robert Bentley also has declared a state of emergency    putting 300 Alabama National Guard soldiers on standby should the storm blow over.  The University of Alabama suspended operations for the day. Eye on the snow  Hardy folks from the North often scoff at Southerners when they clear out store shelves at the mention of a winter storm, but the practice might have originated in another region of the country, according to AccuWeather. com. ”It appears that New Englanders can take credit for the purchasing of milk and bread prior to the storm,” the site reported last year. ”It was the monumental blizzard in 1978 that trapped many in homes for weeks that gets at least some credit for the current tradition.” Amid the run on goods, forecasters are telling people to take warnings and watches seriously. Major airlines issued advisories about potential impact.  FlightAware, an airline tracking website, listed more than 1, 100 cancellations and more than 3, 000 delays as of 8 p. m. ET Friday. Snowstorms in the South are notoriously difficult to forecast, as timing or a change of 1 or 2 degrees can be the difference between several inches or just a cold rain. National Weather Service meteorologists labeled the storm forecast ”tricky” earlier this week.   There is still some uncertainty, as a few forecasting models show precipitation arriving before the temperatures cool down enough to create snow.  There’s also a chance that a narrow band of forecasted higher snow totals could widen, producing heavier snow across a broader area."
31732,31769,50535,Trump downplays Russian meddling in election despite intel report,CNN,Nicole Gaouette,1/6/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN)  Donald Trump downplayed Russia’s role in the election after a briefing with top US intelligence officials, even as a declassified report of their conclusions pointed definitively at Vladimir Putin.  ”While Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations, including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election, including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines,” Trump said in a statement after the meeting. Trump also tried to defuse controversy over his criticism of the intelligence community and continued refusal to accept Moscow’s actions, calling the Friday meeting ”constructive” and offering praise for the senior intel officials. He said he will appoint a team within 90 days to figure out ways to stop foreign hacking. The United States’ most senior intelligence officials briefed Trump on Russian hacking during the election campaign just hours after the   doubled down on his dismissal of the threat as an artificial and politically driven controversy, calling it a ”witch hunt.”  Trump’s meeting with the intel officials took around 90 minutes at Trump Tower. A Trump spokeswoman said the officials who gave the briefing were Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan and FBI Director James Comey. A senior transition official described the meeting between Trump and intelligence community officials as ”cordial,” not contentious. Trump asked questions and made clear his admiration for intelligence community employees, the official added. Based on the presentation Friday, which included new information, the official insisted that it’s the transition’s view that the hacking was intended to harm Hillary Clinton more than to help Trump.  This official pointed to what they were told at the meeting, that the cyberactivity began in late 2015 and early 2016, before it was clear Trump would be the nominee. So, the official asked, how could the hacking be a   operation if it began so early on. ”This was more an effort to discredit her than anything else,” the official said. Biden signs desk in farewell tradition, The official would not weigh in on the intelligence community’s main conclusion that Putin directed the hacking operation, saying it was based on classified information. In a statement Friday accompanying the release of a declassified report on Russian involvement, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said that the ”intelligence community did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election.”  It added that the Department of Homeland Security concluded that ”the types of systems the Russian actors targeted or compromised were not involved in vote tallying.” Democrats seethe, Trump’s public refusal to acknowledge the intelligence community’s conclusions drew sharp responses from Democratic lawmakers Friday. And with the release of the report, Democrats said they will renew their push for a bipartisan independent commission to investigate Russia’s actions. To date, Republicans have insisted on keeping investigations within existing committees that they control. ”There must be a bipartisan, independent, outside commission to understand how Russia hacked into our democratic institutions, and to ensure it never happens again,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat. ”Vladimir Putin’s assault on American democracy was political thuggery in support of Donald Trump, and there must be consequences.” Pelosi, who had earlier called the report’s conclusions ”stunning,” said she is   House legislation that was   Friday and calls for a bipartisan, independent commission. California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, formerly a longstanding member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she and other senators will soon introduce a similar bill.  Hill GOP skeptical over Trump plan to force Mexico payment of border wall, ”This issue must not be politicized    all Americans should be outraged at Russia’s actions, and we must hold them accountable,” she said. Senate Minority Leader and New York Democrat Charles Schumer said, ”That any foreign power could influence an American election should send shivers down the spines of both political parties, regardless of which party benefited this time around . .. We need to confront this interference head on, in an aggressive and bipartisan manner. If we don’t, it’ll be open season for any foreign power who wants to cause trouble in our elections.” Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat and ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, dismissed Trump’s argument out of hand. ”The  ’s statement that the Russian hacking had ’absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election’ is not supported by the briefing, report, or common sense,” Schiff said in a statement. He added that while there was no tampering with vote tallying, ”it is another thing to say that the daily dumping of documents disparaging to Secretary Clinton that was made possible by Russian cyberoperations had no effect on the campaigns.” 11 times VP Biden was interrupted during Trump’s electoral vote certification, Schiff said the   effort was ”hugely beneficial to the   and damaging to the Clinton campaign, just as the Russians intended,” and called on Trump to act ”appropriately in the face of this   Russian malicious activity against America. That starts by accepting the facts. The   must not obfuscate or distract, but deal honestly with the truth of what happened.” One Republican, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, took the opportunity to pressure Trump to get tougher on Moscow. ”I take his statement as an encouraging sign that he wants to push back against those who engaged in cyberattacks against our country’s national security, economic and political interests,” Graham said in a statement.  ”More specifically, when it comes to Russia, I look forward to working with   Trump to achieve those goals,” added Graham, who is pushing to sanction Russia for its activities in cyberspace, Syria and against US allies in Europe. ”Now is the time to throw rocks, not pebbles, and a good place for us to start would be to institute additional punishments on Russia for their cyber interference in the 2016 elections.”  Russia had ’clear preference’ for Trump, Shortly after Trump’s statement, the intelligence community released a declassified version of the report that found Putin had ordered a campaign to influence the 2016 election with the goal of denigrating Clinton, boosting Trump and undermining public faith in the democratic process. Obamas to host one final White House bash, ”We further assess Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for   Trump,” the intelligence report said.  The Russian efforts blended covert activity, including cyber operations, with overt efforts, including paying social media ”trolls.” The operation was just ”the most recent expression of Moscow’s longstanding desire to undermine the   liberal order,” the report said.  The report shared conclusions reached in the classified version, but didn’t include information that could give away sources and collection methods.  Despite the fact that the intelligence community has never argued that the hacks swayed the outcome of the election, Trump and other Republicans have continued to emphasize that point. Intelligence leaders have been careful to stress that voting systems weren’t tampered with, but they told a Senate hearing Thursday that it was impossible to assess how the hacking may have affected voters’ attitudes. After lawmakers and intelligence officials expressed concern at that hearing about Trump’s putdowns of the intelligence community, he praised them in his statement Friday.  ”I have tremendous respect for the work and service done by the men and women of this community to our great nation,” Trump said. Former CIA chief and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta called those comments a step in the right direction for Trump. ”I pray that we get beyond this bickering and tweeting with regards to the intelligence community,” he said on CNN’s ”The Situation Room.” ”And his statement today at least was a step in the right direction. He talked about having a constructive meeting, he indicated he has tremendous respect for the men and women in our intelligence community . .. so I hope that he’s moving in the right direction.” President Barack Obama, who last month asked the intelligence community to provide the comprehensive report on Russia’s cyberactivities last month, was briefed Thursday.  Trump’s muted reaction to the officials’ briefing will not subdue questions about his stance on Russia. Trump has repeatedly rejected the October assessment of all 17 US intelligence agencies that Russia stole and shared emails from Democratic organizations and individuals and probed voting systems in several states.  Throughout the campaign, Trump emphasized his interest in improving relations with Moscow and his admiration for Putin, who he has praised as a strong leader who is ”very smart.” That praise has puzzled observers, who point to Russia’s annexation of Crimea, its alliance with Syrian President Bashar   its attempts to destabilize US allies in Europe, particularly in the Baltic states, its harassment of US diplomats, and its systematic expulsion of American   Organizations in Russia.  Trump has derided intelligence agencies for weeks, setting off the word ”intelligence” in quotation marks to indicate his skepticism and suggesting their conclusions were politically motivated. That idea is anathema to officers who pride themselves on providing ”unvarnished” and ”untainted” information to policy makers, Clapper said. California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell and Maryland Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings   a bill Friday to establish a bipartisan,   commission that has the support of 170 House lawmakers. The legislation calls for the commission to examine Russia’s hacking as well as cyber intrusions by other nations and produce a report with recommendations to the President within 18 months.  Over 50, 000 Americans have signed a petition released Friday urging Congress to create an independent commission, telling lawmakers that ”regardless of whether you voted for Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, or anyone else, Russia’s attacks on our election are an attempt to degrade our democracy.” CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated Nancy Pelosi’s title."
31733,31770,50536,A clash of identities,CNN,Daniella Diaz,1/6/17,2017,1,," (CNN) This election was not easy for me. The 2016 campaign challenged me to figure out how to do my job as a journalist while remaining unbiased    even as my own people were regularly berated by the candidate who ultimately won. It tested the very core of who I am and what kind of legacy I want to leave as the   daughter of two hardworking and humble Mexican immigrants. I became a journalist to make a difference in this changing world. I am not a Democrat or a Republican I am a reporter who strives to write honestly and fairly about candidates and officeholders. But when Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants ”rapists” and ”criminals,” adding that he assumed ”some are good people,” those remarks resonated with my community    and with me. The immigrants I know are honest and industrious. My parents came to the United States to create a better life for their children. And they were successful: My three siblings and I are     who are working to make this country a better place. Still, I had a job to do. I could not    would not    take sides. I reported on Trump for a year and a half, and I did so fairly, in the nonpartisan manner that my profession demands. There were many days when I struggled to shut off my cultural identity so that I could focus on my job. There were days when I wanted to exclaim to whomever would listen that   are people, too    people who contribute to this country, who become citizens and vote in this country, and who matter to this country as much as any other group. There were times when I doubted that my work was improving the perception many in this country have of Latinos. I wasn’t the only reporter to be tested by this election. It wasn’t easy for my colleagues who are     and even women    members of groups that Trump offended repeatedly during the race. But at one point during the campaign    near my breaking point    I had a tender conversation with my mother while visiting my parents’ home in McAllen, Texas, on the South Texas border: ”Mijita, tienes que seguir tu lucha, (My little daughter, you need to continue your fight),” my mother told me. ”¿Por qué? (Why? )” I asked, downcast by the barrage of negative rhetoric on the campaign trail. ”Por que si tu no lo haces, nadie lo va hacer, (Because if you don’t do it, nobody will),” she told me. And with that, she reminded me why I woke up every day, why I faced this responsibility  . I don’t regret taking this job to cover the 2016 election. In fact, it’s been the best decision I’ve ever made. And now that Trump is going to be the president, I look forward to covering him as a political reporter these next four years. Because one of the most important components of a functioning government is a strong Fourth Estate    the freedom of the press. That freedom is one that I wouldn’t have if I were a reporter in another country, even the one directly south of the border. And it’s that freedom and others that make America exceptional. It’s one of the reasons  my parents chose to make this country their home, and why I’m proud to call it my own."
31734,31771,50537,Lake Erie plane crash: Voice recorder found,CNN,,1/7/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Divers recovered the cockpit voice recorder, pieces of debris and possible human remains from an airplane that went missing over Lake Erie on Dec. 29, Cleveland city officials said Friday. The airplane, a   Cessna 525 Citation, was headed for the Ohio State University airport from Cleveland, according to the Coast Guard. It disappeared from the radar about two miles over Lake Erie after it took off from Burke Lakefront Airport in downtown Cleveland, according to the Coast Guard.  Six people were on board. The plane was registered to John T. Fleming, a beverage company executive. He was flying the plane when it disappeared, his father told The Columbus Dispatch. Fleming’s wife, Suzanne two sons, John Robert, 15, and Andrew Thomas, 14 a neighbor and a neighbor’s daughter were also on board. Fleming was taking his family and friends to a Cleveland Cavaliers game as a treat for the holidays, his father, John W. Fleming, told the newspaper. The night the plane went missing, search and recovery efforts were initially hindered by   to   waves on Lake Erie, according to the Coast Guard. Poor conditions on the lake have made the recovery process difficult, National Transportation Safety Board investigator Tim Sorensen said at a news conference Friday.  The city deployed three boats and a dive team to search Lake Erie early Friday. The divers retrieved the cockpit voice recorder by the afternoon, along with a piece of the airplane’s tail, a seat from the passenger compartment and other pieces of debris. The divers also collected what appear to be human remains, and those remains are now being analyzed, city officials said at the news conference. The cockpit voice recorder was intact, said Fred Szabo, the interim director of the Cleveland Department of Port Control. The recorder is being sent to Washington for analysis at the NTSB lab, according to Sorensen. Both Szabo and Sorensen said the investigation is still in the initial stages. ”We don’t know the timeline for the recovery,” Szabo said. ”From the city’s perspective, we are going to continue our recovery and salvage operations.”  Sorensen said the NTSB has already started collecting records and will be reviewing them shortly. ”Once the recovery operation is complete, we will begin examining the wreckage documented,” Sorensen said. Burke Lakefront Airport Commissioner Khalid Bahhur read statements from the families of those on board the plane. The relatives expressed their gratitude towards everyone working on the search and recovery process. ”We, the Fleming and Armeni families, continue to be touched by the tremendous outpouring of support and are incredibly appreciative of all the individuals who have aided in the search and recovery efforts to date,” the statement said. ”We extend our deep appreciation for the concern, kindness, and privacy shown by so many during this most difficult time.”"
31735,31772,50538,Putin’s ’act of war’ against American democracy,CNN,Frida Ghitis,1/7/17,2017,1,," (CNN) US intelligence agencies released on Friday an alarming report about a hostile foreign country’s efforts to subvert America’s system of government, and the incoming president does not seem to understand the danger of the situation. In a   document, the country’s top intelligence experts declared that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign to influence the US presidential election. ”Russia’s goals,” they concluded, ”were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability.”  This is an extraordinary accusation, and the intelligence chiefs are fully aware of that. It is not a     spying operation: It was a plot aimed at corroding the foundation of America’s system of government and    as the report puts it    upending ”the   liberal democratic order.” That means that Russia’s objectives, despite Trump’s victory, have not been fully achieved.   If that were not enough reason for alarm, Trump’s reaction shows he either doesn’t comprehend the seriousness of the matter, he does not care or, perhaps, as some have suggested, he’s not committed to America’s democracy. In fact, it seems that the   is only able to view the issue through his  . Somehow, he cannot look beyond the impact this has on his image as the winner of the election. That   view is in sharp contrast with Republicans (and Democrats) in Congress who have managed to rise above partisanship to face up to what has just happened. While Republican Sen. John McCain called Russia’s actions  ”an act of war,” and House Speaker Paul Ryan, also a Republican, acknowledged  that Russia ”clearly tried to meddle in our political system,” Trump is caught in his solipsistic house of mirrors.  Just before receiving a classified briefing on the intelligence, the   gave a telephone interview to The New York Times in which he belittled the significance what occurred and called the commotion surrounding the findings of Russia’s hacking and other activities a political witch hunt by Democrats embarrassed by their election loss.  After he was briefed by the intelligence chiefs, he accepted the possibility of a Russian hack, but grudgingly and with no appearance that he grasped the magnitude and significance of what occurred. He released a statement saying he and the intelligence briefers had a ”constructive meeting,” but his statement’s principal thrust was the claim that, ”there was absolutely no effect on the [election] outcome whatsoever,” and no tampering with voting machines. Huh? Clearly, Trump misses the point. This is not about him it is about protecting the country he has been elected to govern from an active and deliberate threat. In his statement, Trump vowed to get tough on hacking from various countries, but did not indicate he viewed Russia as the culprit in the election interference operation. The Russian interference campaign, as it happens, was not just hacking, even if actions by Russian and   hackers played a major part in the operation. Russia’s activities    which we have seen targeting other Western democracies    included a vast array of techniques.  Hacking the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chief John Podesta’s emails were important elements of the Russian efforts. The report shows how the hack was carried out and how the documents were handed to WikiLeaks for dissemination. ”Moscow’s influence campaign,” as the intelligence report calls it, blended a variety of means, including covert cyberactivity by Russian intelligence operatives, along with ”with overt   media,   intermediaries, and paid social media users or ’trolls’.”  And there was Trump himself, who peddled the material to his followers, making it sound as if the hacks contained truly explosive information.  All those Clinton emails, in fact, were the least of it. Few people read them, but many people believed the claim that they contained great and horrifying secrets.   The greater effort was in painting Clinton as unfit to lead. Putin, as we wrote months ago and as US intelligence experts concluded, ”developed a clear preference” for Trump over Clinton. When he thought Clinton would win despite Russia’s multipronged effort to cast doubt on her, the plan shifted to undercutting the credibility of the election.  The report says   government bloggers were all set to launch a #DemocracyRIP campaign after a Clinton win, to undercut the election’s credibility. Curiously, Trump had also strongly suggested that if he lost it would be because of fraud. Putin made a big push to help Trump win. He deployed his ”news” agencies, RT and Sputnik, along with a vast social media machine to promote false accusations that Clinton was corrupt, ill, mentally unstable and linked to Islamist groups. As it happens, Trump did the same, promoting precisely that unfounded description of his rival, all the way to electoral victory.  The looming question is what, if anything, Trump will do to stop this Russian assault on democracy. Will he carry on his plan to repair relations with the Kremlin without taking any action? Will he lift the modest sanctions just imposed by President Barack Obama? Trump concluded his statement today saying, ”America’s safety and security will be my number one priority.” What is not clear is whether American democracy is also a priority. The   is playing a risky game by downplaying this matter and resisting the intelligence community’s conclusions. Even before he takes office, the issue has already opened a rift with fellow Republicans, and it has raised piercing questions that he cannot afford to ignore.  As Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer said, Trump’s continued  denial of Russia’s intervention in the election, ”would raise questions about where his sympathies truly lie.”"
31736,31773,50539,Is Sessions Trump’s scariest Cabinet pick?,CNN,,1/6/17,2017,1,," (CNN)”Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is Trump’s scariest pick of all?” Even a magical mirror would have a tough time answering this question, given how many stunningly bad people   Donald Trump has chosen for his administration.   There’s Steve Bannon    Trump’s chief strategist    whose selection elicited cheers from white supremacists. There’s Trump’s nominee for national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who has a history of embracing wild conspiracy theories and backing some of the nation’s most notorious   activists.   But the worst of this horror show may very well be Trump’s choice for attorney general: Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, known to most as U. S. Sen. Jeff Sessions.  It’s a selection that should concern Americans who believe in equal rights for all.  If confirmed as attorney general, the Alabama Republican would have vast powers such as serving as the chief law enforcement officer for the federal government, providing legal opinions to the President on key issues and deciding when the Department of Justice will become involved in fighting for the civil rights of Americans.   That’s troubling because of Sessions’   views on issues ranging from equal pay for women to voting rights to the LGBT, which are   extreme. We aren’t talking mainstream conservative views, but a worldview that is often far to the right, skirting outright bigotry.  Here’s a sampler of Sessions’ views on key issues that should send shivers down your spine: Racism, In 1986, when President Ronald Reagan nominated Sessions to a federal judgeship, he was voted down by the   Senate Judiciary Committee, making him only the second judicial nominee in 50 years to be rejected. Why? Well, at the hearings, the senators heard allegations of Sessions’ history of doing things like calling a black lawyer ”boy” joking that the Ku Klux Klan was ”okay, until he learned that they smoked marijuana” and that he had described the NAACP as ” ” and ”Communist inspired.” Sessions even allegedly stated that the NAACP and American Civil Liberties Union were trying to force civil rights ”down the throats of people.”  Women’s issues, Sessions    who appeared to suggest, after Trump’s infamous ”Access Hollywood” video was released, that he wasn’t sure grabbing a woman by the genitals would constitute ”sexual assault”    shockingly voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act in 2013. In addition, he has consistently voted against legislation that would protect equal pay for women, including the Paycheck Fairness Act and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009.  And Sessions not only supported an unconstitutional complete ban on abortions after 20 weeks, which violates Roe v. Wade, but he also voted against federal protections for reproductive clinics against violence.   LGBT issues, Sessions was one of the senators to oppose the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, signed into law in 2009. The law extended federal hate crime protection to people victimized for their sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or disability. Yet Sessions    who has supported a constitutional amendment to ban marriage equality    astoundingly suggested that extending hate crime protection for the LGBT community would ”cheapen the civil rights movement.”   Voting rights, Sessions described the seminal Voting Rights Act of 1965, enacted to prevent state and local officials from imposing barriers to disenfranchise black voters, as a ”piece of intrusive legislation.” And in 2013, after the U. S. Supreme Court struck down an important enforcement provision of that law, Sessions opposed efforts to update it, remarking that ”the justification no longer exists.” (In reality, various     laws were struck down in 2016 by federal courts for unconstitutionally depriving people of color the right to vote.) And these are just a few reasons why so many oppose Sessions’ nomination. Just this week, more than 1, 200 law professors signed a letter urging the Senate to reject Sessions, declaring that ”we are convinced that Jeff Sessions will not fairly enforce our nation’s laws and promote justice and equality in the United States.” In 2015, I attended a dinner where current Attorney General Loretta Lynch told a roomful of   that we    along with other minority communities    were not alone, since she was standing with us against hate crimes and attempts to deprive us of our rights. But with Sessions as attorney general, it appears that many communities will be even worse off than if they were standing alone. It appears that women, people of color, the LGBT community and others have a person in Sessions who actually opposes equal rights for all Americans. With that in mind, and given Sessions’ own record, under no circumstances should he be confirmed as attorney general of our great nation."
31737,31775,50541,Obama: ’Vladimir Putin is not on our team’,CNN,Kevin Liptak,1/7/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN) President Barack Obama says he’s concerned about Republican commentators who appear to side with Russia over the US, saying Russian President Vladimir Putin should not be trusted. ”What is true is that the Russians intended to meddle and they meddled,” Obama told ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos in an interview that aired Friday. ”One of the things I am concerned about is the degree to which we’ve seen a lot of commentary lately where there are Republicans or pundits or cable commentators who seem to have more confidence in Vladimir Putin than fellow Americans because those fellow Americans are Democrats.” ”That cannot be,” Obama insisted. Asked if he was describing   Donald Trump, Obama demurred. ”Well, what I will say is that    and I said that after the election    we have to remind ourselves that we’re on the same team,” Obama said. ”Vladimir Putin is not on our team.” Obama’s administration released a declassified version of an intelligence report Friday that indicates Putin ordered an ”influence campaign” in the US election meant to hurt Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. On Thursday, Obama’s top intelligence officials spent an hour briefing him on the report’s findings in the Oval Office. A day later, they offered a similar briefing to Trump, who openly questions the intelligence linking Russia to the election meddling. After his briefing Friday, Trump said in a statement that hacking efforts had ”absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.” He went on to vow that as President, he would appoint a team to generate a cybersecurity plan within 90 days of his inauguration."
31738,31776,50542,Intel report: Putin directly ordered effort to influence election,CNN,Jeremy Diamond,1/6/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN) The US intelligence community concluded in a declassified report released Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an ”influence campaign” aimed at hurting Hillary Clinton and helping Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. The campaign    which consisted of hacking Democratic groups and individuals, including Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, and releasing that information via   websites, including WikiLeaks    amounted to what the intelligence report called ”a significant escalation” in longtime Russian efforts to undermine ”the   liberal democratic order.” The report was the first official, full and public accounting by the US intelligence community of its assessment of Russian cyberhacking activities during the 2016 campaign and the motivations behind that hacking. ”We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for   Trump,” the report said.  ”Russian efforts to influence the 2016 US presidential election represent the most recent expression of Moscow’s longstanding desire to undermine the   liberal democratic order, but these activities demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations,” the report continued. The report said Moscow used a variety of tactics in a bid to sway the outcome.   ”Moscow’s influence campaign followed a Russian messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence operations    such as cyberactivity    with overt efforts by Russian government agencies,   media,   intermediaries and paid social media users or ’trolls,’ ” the report found. The US intelligence community released several new pieces of information to support its conclusions. It noted that in the final   to the election, when polls favored Clinton to win the election, Moscow shifted its campaign to influence the election to one aimed at undermining the validity of the electoral results. ”Before the election, Russian diplomats had already publicly denounced the US electoral process and were prepared to publicly call into question the validity of the results,” the reported stated, adding that   government bloggers had prepared a Twitter campaign on Election Night using the hashtag ”#DemocracyRIP.” US intelligence officials also assessed ”with high confidence” that the GRU Russian intelligence agency ”used the Guccifer 2. 0 persona, DCLeaks. com, and WikiLeaks to release US victim data obtained in cyberoperations publicly.” The intelligence community also assessed ”with high confidence” that the GRU provided WikiLeaks with the material they obtained from hacking the Democratic National Committee and top Democratic officials. US intelligence agencies also noted in the report that the Russian influence campaign was not limited to the cyberhacking and release of private documents that drew headlines during the presidential campaign. The report stated that the campaign blended cyberhacking intelligence operations with overt propaganda efforts carried out by   media outlets and paid social media users. The propaganda efforts included Russian   media outlets like Russia Today and Sputnik casting Trump as ”the target of unfair coverage from traditional US media outlets” as well as Russian propaganda officials casting Trump during the campaign as a victim of the US political establishment.  Meanwhile, the intelligence community noted that ”RT’s coverage of Secretary Clinton . .. was consistently negative and focused on her leaked emails and accused her of corruption, poor physical and mental health, and ties to Islamic extremism.” Clinton’s campaign first argued Russia was aiming to help Trump back in July, to which Trump’s campaign called the comment ”a joke.” After the election, Clinton argued to donors that Putin got involved in the 2016 election partially due to a grudge against her, a view that’s backed up in Friday’s report. ”Putin most likely wanted to discredit Secretary Clinton because he has publicly blamed her since 2011 for inciting mass protests against his regime in late 2011 and early 2012, and because he holds a grudge for comments he almost certainly saw as disparaging him,” the report said. The Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. But Jesse Lehrich, a spokesman for Clinton’s campaign, expressed vindication Friday afternoon, tweeting:  ”every day: REPORTER: what about *this* @wikileaks email? ME: part of an unprecedented foreign cyberattack! !! REPORTER: so. .. no comment?” And Robby Mook, Clinton’s campaign manager, asked on Twitter, ”What is stopping PEOTUS from accepting intel community’s findings?  Until he accepts them, he is effectively siding   Putin over U. S.” Trump briefed, The report, which was commissioned by President Barack Obama, comes as Trump has continued to resist the US intelligence community’s conclusions that Russia was responsible for the hacking and that it aimed to help his campaign. Trump was briefed earlier Friday on the report by top US intelligence and law enforcement officials, and while he said he had ”a constructive meeting,” he declined to publicly agree with their conclusions. Instead, Trump stressed that ”there was absolutely no effect on the outcome whatsoever,” which the US intelligence community asserted in its report it was not in a position to assess. Trump did acknowledge in his statement the possibility that Russia could have been behind the hack, though he named China as well as a persistent cyberhacker. The US intelligence community also warned in its report Friday that Moscow would likely continue to pursue cyberhacking campaigns to influence future elections. ”Moscow will apply lessons learned from its   campaign aimed at the US presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide, including against US allies and their election processes,” it assessed. The 17 US intelligence agencies first concluded in October that Russian intelligence, directed by the most senior Russian officials, orchestrated the hacking of Democratic Party organizations. But since then, the US intelligence community said it had gathered additional information to make assessments of the motivations behind the cyberhacking operations: that the effort was aimed at undermining the US democratic process, hurting Clinton and helping Trump in the 2016 presidential election."

Two more Republican senators in the last 24 hours are sounding the alarm that repealing Obamacare without a replacement plan in place may not be good for the health of the GOP . .. much less the country. But will it stop them from voting for a repeal? That may be a step too far. Meanwhile, President Barack Obama says he’s ready to give Republicans credit and offer his full support if his political rivals prescribe a better health care program. Obamacare, Sens. Corker and Cotton are the latest GOPers to warn against repeal without replace. Here’s a wrap of the GOP’s early stumbling blocks on repeal. With a narrow   majority, and potential defections from Rand Paul, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins, Republicans need Cotton on board to pass the repeal. Obama sat down with Vox to discuss Obamacare and challenged the GOP to spell out its alternative. He said he’s willing to support a good plan.  Republican leaders are pushing hard to defund Planned Parenthood, but the move might hurt their efforts to repeal Obamacare. Planned Parenthood also delivered 86, 739 petitions to Speaker Ryan’s office opposing the move, while 37 Democratic Senators sent a letter to Ryan urging him to ”cease ’harmful, partisan’ path toward defunding Planned Parenthood.” A Donald   Obamacare enrollee in Florida shares his worries with CNN’s Sanjay Gupta.

Trump took to Twitter insisting Mexico will pay for the wall later, but did not reveal how that will happen. Asked about Mexico paying for it, Sen. Orrin Hatch told CNN’s Manu Raju late Friday, ”I doubt that they’re going to pay for it.” A number of immigration activist groups have called for a ”National Day of Action” on January 14 to protest potential Trump immigration policies. They plan on holding demonstrations in 20 states plus DC. The Wall Street Journal reports on conservative immigrations groups pressuring Trump to create an immigration position for   Kris Kobach. Congress seems ready to overhaul the   program to crack down on abuse.     Bloomberg profiled an obscure and very conservative group, the Institute for Energy Research, which was founded by a former Enron exec, and its advocacy arm the American Energy Alliance, which is led by a former Koch Industries lobbyist, that has taken an outsized role in shaping Trump’s environmental and energy policies.

31741,31779,50545,Why proving source of a cyberattack is so damn difficult,CNN,,1/5/17,2017,1,," (CNN) President Barack Obama’s public accusation of Russia as the source of the hacks in the US presidential election and the leaking of sensitive emails through WikiLeaks and other sources has opened up a debate on what constitutes sufficient evidence to attribute an attack in cyberspace. The answer is both complicated and inherently tied up in political considerations.  The administration is balancing political considerations and the inherent secrecy of electronic espionage with the need to justify its actions to the public. These issues will continue to plague us as more international conflict plays out in cyberspace. It’s true that it’s easy for an attacker to hide who he is in cyberspace. We are unable to identify particular pieces of hardware and software around the world positively. We can’t verify the identity of someone sitting in front of a keyboard through computer data alone. Internet data packets don’t come with return addresses, and it’s easy for attackers to disguise their origins. For decades, hackers have used techniques such as jump hosts, VPNs, Tor and open relays to obscure their origin, and in many cases they work. I’m sure that many national intelligence agencies route their attacks through China, simply because everyone knows lots of attacks come from China.  On the other hand, there are techniques that can identify attackers with varying degrees of precision. It’s rarely just one thing, and you’ll often hear the term ”constellation of evidence” to describe how a particular attacker is identified. It’s analogous to traditional detective work. Investigators collect clues and piece them together with known mode of operations. They look for elements that resemble other attacks and elements that are anomalies. The clues might involve ones and zeros, but the techniques go back to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The University of   organization Citizen Lab routinely attributes attacks against the computers of activists and dissidents to particular Third World governments. It took months to identify China as the source of the 2012 attacks against The New York Times. While it was uncontroversial to say that Russia was the source of a cyberattack against Estonia in 2007, no one knew if those attacks were authorized by the Russian government    until the attackers explained themselves. And it was the Internet security company CrowdStrike, which first attributed the attacks against the Democratic National Committee to Russian intelligence agencies in June, based on multiple pieces of evidence gathered from its forensic investigation.  Attribution is easier if you are monitoring broad swaths of the Internet. This gives the National Security Agency a singular advantage in the attribution game. The problem, of course, is that the NSA doesn’t want to publish what it knows. Regardless of what the government knows and how it knows it, the decision of whether to make attribution evidence public is another matter. When Sony was attacked, many security experts    myself included    were skeptical of both the government’s attribution claims and the flimsy evidence associated with it. I only became convinced when The New York Times ran a story about the government’s attribution, which talked about both secret evidence inside the NSA and human intelligence assets inside North Korea. In contrast, when the Office of Personnel Management was breached in 2015, the US government decided not to accuse China publicly, either because it didn’t want to escalate the political situation or because it didn’t want to reveal any secret evidence. The Obama administration has been more public about its evidence in the DNC case, but it has not been entirely public. It’s one thing for the government to know who attacked it. It’s quite another for it to convince the public who attacked it. As attribution increasingly relies on secret evidence    as it did with North Korea’s attack of Sony in 2014 and almost certainly does regarding Russia and the previous election    the government is going to have to face the choice of making previously secret evidence public and burning sources and methods, or keeping it secret and facing perfectly reasonable skepticism.  If the government is going to take public action against a cyberattack, it needs to make its evidence public. But releasing secret evidence might get people killed, and it would make any future confidentiality assurances we make to human sources completely  . This problem isn’t going away secrecy helps the intelligence community, but it wounds our democracy. The constellation of evidence attributing the attacks against the DNC, and subsequent release of information, is comprehensive. It’s possible that there was more than one attack. It’s possible that someone not associated with Russia leaked the information to WikiLeaks, although we have no idea where that someone else would have obtained the information. We know that the Russian actors who hacked the DNC    both the FSB, Russia’s principal security agency, and the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence unit    are also attacking other political networks around the world. In the end, though, attribution comes down to whom you believe. When Citizen Lab writes a report outlining how a United Arab Emirates human rights defender was targeted with a cyberattack, we have no trouble believing that it was the UAE government. When Google identifies China as the source of attacks against Gmail users, we believe it just as easily.  Obama decided not to make the accusation public before the election so as not to be seen as influencing the election. Now, afterward, there are political implications in accepting that Russia hacked the DNC in an attempt to influence the US presidential election. But no amount of evidence can convince the inconvincible. The most important thing we can do right now is deter any country from trying this sort of thing in the future, and the political nature of the issue makes that harder. Right now, we’ve told the world that others can get away with manipulating our election process as long as they can keep their efforts secret until after one side wins. Obama has promised both secret retaliations and public ones. We need to hope they’re enough. "
31742,31780,50546,Hill GOP skeptical over Trump plan to force Mexico payment of border wall,CNN,Manu Raju,1/6/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN)  Donald Trump is still insisting that Mexico will ultimately pay billions for the construction of a massive wall along the southern border. Many Republicans on Capitol Hill are not so sure. In interviews with CNN, a number of Republicans suggested that Trump’s claim amounted to wishful thinking, saying they believed the billionaire businessman would ultimately backtrack on one of his central campaign promises. ”I doubt that they’re going to pay for it,” said Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, the   Senate Republican, referring to Mexico. ”There’s a lot he could do if he wanted to (force Mexico’s hand). In all honesty, I don’t think that’s going to happen.” Rep. Mike Coffman, a Colorado Republican, added: ”I never thought that would happen. I thought it was a gimmick.” And some conservatives warned Trump would face a backlash if he failed to follow through. ”I’m for building a wall,” said Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama. ”And I’m for Donald Trump keeping his promise to the American people that Mexico pay for it.” He added that he would be ”disappointed” if Trump failed to deliver. House GOP sources tell CNN that Trump’s transition team has urged Republican leaders to include funding for the wall in a spending package that must pass by April 28 in order to keep the government open. The price tag is uncertain, but some similar proposals have been projected to cost upwards of $10 billion. Trump insists his rhetoric is no gimmick, telling The New York Times Friday that Mexico will reimburse the United States, using negotiations over revamping the North American Free Trade Agreement as leverage against the country. He has also previously warned of imposing punitive measures on Mexico if the country does not comply. ”We’re going to get reimbursed,” Trump said. ”But I don’t want to wait that long. But you start, and then you get reimbursed.” Top Republican leaders were cautious in their assessment, including Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican. ”Well right now, they’re pretty uncertain as to what all of this means,” Cornyn said of his constituents in his border state. He said he urged Trump’s nominee for secretary of the treasury, Steve Mnuchin, to ”make sure there aren’t any unintended consequences of this.” ”About 6 million American jobs depend on   trade with Mexico,” Cornyn told CNN. Some House conservatives also were skeptical. Asked if he believed that Trump would succeed in persuading Mexico to pay for the wall, Rep. Dave Brat of Virginia said: ”Not in some big, they’re going to hand us a big check   .” But he added: ”There’ll be a policy in place where we can compensate the cost they’re imposing.” Even getting the funding bill through Congress could be difficult. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Friday the plan would be a ”tough sell” to Democrats. And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is waiting to discuss the matter more fully with his caucus, but he’d have the power to block the measure in the Senate if he kept Senate Democrats largely in line against it. But if Congress ends up stuck with the tab, it’s clear some conservatives may not be happy. ”I’m for securing the border for the American people, and we’re going to be sure we get that done,” said Rep. Jim Jordan,   a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. Asked if that meant he’d support Trump’s plan to have Congress pay for it first, Jordan deadpanned: ”I didn’t say that.” And he walked into an elevator."
31743,31782,50548,Ft. Lauderdale shooting witness: ’Like a war zone’,CNN,Alexandra King,1/6/17,2017,1,," (CNN) People who witnessed the shooting or its aftermath at the Fort   International Airport Friday described the scene as a ”war zone” and ”mass hysteria.” Dwayne Dickerson spoke to CNN’s Brooke Baldwin live from a supply closet in the airport where he and other frightened travelers were huddled together, hiding. ”We were all here in Terminal 2 at Delta when the shooting started and everybody just scattered. It was mass hysteria,” he described. ”I jumped over the counter once I realized it was shooting.”   ”Now, we’re kind of in and out, trying to see what’s going on, and see when they’re going to clear us, and let us. ..and when it’s safe. But now we’re hearing this active second shooter,” he said. Authorities later said there was no evidence of another gunman and they believe the shooter, who was taken into custody without incident, acted alone.  David Steiger described himself as ”one of the lucky ones.” He said that he had just left the baggage claim area when he saw people running toward him, screaming that there was a shooter. ”I heard faint muffled sounds in the background. I couldn’t tell if it was a shot being fired but I could tell something was going on and the people running towards me were scared,” he said. That was when he ducked down to hide. ”I had a woman hide behind me actually, as I was kind of huddled in a corner hoping that no shots were going to be fired my way,” Steiger said. ”I was right in the middle of it. It was definitely scary, shocking,” he added. Another witness said he heard that some of the passengers who had been on his flight  were among the victims. Erik Whiteside said that he, his wife and children had just left the baggage claim area when the commotion started. ”All a sudden everybody started running,” he said, ”I grabbed our kids and took off running down the ramp. We ran to hide behind some luggage carts.” When Whiteside and his family were allowed to return to the baggage hall, the scene, he said, was chaotic. ”It was like a war zone in here, suitcases everywhere, food on the floor, hats in the middle of the ground, nothing to be claimed. It was just a really surreal experience.” Now, he said, he was stranded at the terminal surrounded by at least 600 other people. ”It’s definitely a stressful situation,” he said. Another traveler, also stranded at the airport, fought back tears as she described the moment she realized something was wrong. ”I was kind of waiting between Terminal 1 and the rental car place. Everybody started running out of Terminal 1,” she described. She said the rest of her family was inside Terminal 2. ”So I just ran and here I am.” In the commotion, she said, she ended up being separated from her family, who had sought shelter elsewhere in the airport. ”My    grandma is in there, she ran,” she said."
31744,31783,50549,Chicago torture video: No bail for 4 suspects,CNN,Catherine E. Shoichet,1/6/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Four young people accused of torturing a Chicago   teen and broadcasting the incident on Facebook Live were ordered held without bail Friday afternoon. The suspects face hate crime, kidnapping, unlawful restraint and battery charges in their alleged role in the attack.  ”I’m wondering where was the sense of decency that each of you should have had?” Cook County Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil asked the suspects. ”When the mom reached out asking about his child . .. Where was it? I don’t see it.” The decision to deny them bail brought cheers in the courtroom. After the hearing, Assistant State’s Attorney Erin Antonetti told reporters the    victim suffers from schizophrenia and   hyperactivity disorder. He  was friends with one of the suspects, Jordan Hill, and was voluntarily spending time with him, starting on New Year’s Eve, she said. The attacks started in the back of a stolen van after Hill apparently became angry because the victim’s mother called and asked about her son’s location, Antonetti said.  Hill took the teen to a   apartment in Chicago, where he was bound and gagged, beaten over several days by the two male and two female suspects and forced to drink toilet water, with some of the attacks broadcast on Facebook Live, she said. ”During the course of the attack, defendant Hill communicated with the victim’s mother and demanded $300 ransom in exchange for getting her son back,” Antonetti said. The youth finally escaped Tuesday when police came to the apartment because the suspects argued with   residents who’d complained about the noise, she said. The victim was treated at a hospital and released. Hate crime charges, Jordan Hill, 18 Tesfaye Cooper 18 Brittany Covington, 18 and Tanishia Covington, 24, have each been charged with a hate crime, felony aggravated kidnapping, aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.  Hill, Cooper and Brittany Covington also face charges of residential burglary. Hill faces an additional charge of possession of a stolen motor vehicle.  Public defenders Wendy Fawcettt and Megan Tomlinson provided personal details about the defendants, saying Tanishia Covington has two children and Brittany Covington worked as a cashier and attended church. Hill lives with his grandmother and six siblings, ages 14 to 20, and played football in high school, the public defenders said. He’d spent time in jail in for prior convictions, the defenders said. Cooper lives with his mother and six siblings, has a paralyzed brother and had been arrested previously for possession of a controlled substance, the public defenders said. Graphic video, Video of the attack shows the victim cowering in a corner of a room, tied up with his mouth bound in plastic. An assailant slashes his sweatshirt with a knife. A woman streaming the abuse on Facebook Live repeatedly turns the camera back to herself. An attacker then takes a knife to the victim’s head, carving a patch off his scalp.  For the next 25 minutes, the abuse continues for the world to see. The victim is repeatedly kicked and punched, but his screams are apparently ignored.  The graphic footage has stunned the country, not just because of the abuse, but because of the comments made by some of the assailants.  ”*F*ck Donald Trump!” one attacker shouted in the video. ”F*ck white people!” Antonetti  the prosecutor, said the victim was forced to yell ”I love black people” and ”*F*ck Donald Trump!” Police said the department pursued a hate crime charge because of the victim’s diminished mental capacity, the fact that the four suspects tied him up and the racial epithets heard on the video. The victim is white the suspects are  . Facebook Live is changing our world    is that a good thing?  Police: No link with Black Lives Matter, Although there is no evidence to support the claim, the   quickly pointed the finger at the Black Lives Matter movement as the video spread on social media. Within 24 hours, the hashtag #BLMKidnapping was mentioned more than 480, 000 times on Twitter. Police have said there’s no connection between the activist group and the horrific video. Neither the Black Lives Matter national organization nor its Chicago chapter responded to CNN’s requests for comment Thursday. DeRay Mckesson, a prominent Black Lives Matter supporter, said those linking the attack to the movement don’t have their facts straight. ”It goes without saying that the actions being branded by the   as the ’BLM Kidnapping’ have nothing to do   the movement,” he tweeted. A former Chicago police officer, Dimitri Roberts, slammed the notion that the Black Lives Matter movement is to blame.  ”This is hate. And hate doesn’t have a color,” Roberts said. ”So for folks to talk about this is somehow connected to Black Lives Matter is absolutely the wrong way to look at this. . ..  And we cannot respond to hate with hate. It’s just going to perpetuate the cycle.”  How the encounter began, The victim’s parents dropped him off at a McDonald’s in the Chicago suburb of Schaumburg on Saturday, December 31, to meet a friend. Antonetti said the teen called home on Saturday and asked to spend the night with the friend and asked the same thing on January 1. On January 2, he stopped communicating with home, Antonetti said. That same day, the teen’s brother got on Facebook and determined Hill was the friend the victim was with, Antonetti said. Antonetti said Hill stole a van December 31 and drove around in it with the victim, plus other people. Hill took the youth to the apartment in Chicago, where he was held captive and abused, Antonitti said. By Monday, his parents had reported him missing, and they began getting text messages from someone claiming to be holding him captive, police said. Antonitti said the Facebook Live broadcasts apparently began Tuesday and were shot by Brittany Covington. While the suspects were arguing with neighbors, the victim ran out of the apartment and police found him on the street wearing an   tank top, shorts and sandals on a cold winter day, police said. ”He was bloodied, he was battered,” Officer Michael Donnelly said. ”He was very discombobulated.” While investigating the text messages sent to the victim’s parents, police discovered the Facebook video.  After viewing the video, investigators determined the victim was the teen found on the street    and that the people arrested were involved, police said."
31745,31784,50550,11 times electoral vote count was interrupted,CNN,Brenna Williams,1/6/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Vice President Joe Biden presided over a joint session of Congress Friday, where members officially tallied electoral votes from the 2016 presidential election.   Donald Trump’s 304 electoral votes weren’t counted without incident, however. During the course of the certification, House Democrats tried to object to electoral votes from multiples states, with Biden gaveling them down for failure to follow the rules. Objections to the votes needed to be in writing and signed by both a member of the House and a member of the Senate. Every House member who rose to object did so without a senator’s signature.  1:09 P. M. ET: Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts rose to object to the certificate from Alabama.  ”The electors were not lawfully certified, especially given the confirmed and illegal activities engaged by the government of Russia,” McGovern said. Biden denied McGovern on the grounds that he didn’t have a senator’s signature on his written objection. 1:14 P. M.: Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland rose to object to 10 of Florida’s 29 electoral votes.  ”They violated Florida’s prohibition against dual office holders,” Raskin said. Again, despite the fact that Raskin pointed out that he had his objection in writing, he failed to get a senator’s signature.  1:15 P. M.: No sooner had the Florida question been settled than its neighbor to the north was the subject of another objection, when Washington’s Rep. Pramila Jayapal objected to Georgia’s vote certificate. ”It is over,” Biden told the congresswoman. 1:21 P. M.: Rep. Barbara Lee of California brought up voting machines and Russian hacking when she objected following the counting of Michigan’s votes. ”People are horrified by the overwhelming evidence of Russian interference in our election,” Lee said. Once again, her objection was denied for the lack of a senator’s signature. They also turned off her microphone. 1:23 P. M.: After New York’s tally was read, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas stood up to object. ”I object on the massive voter suppression that included   ” Jackson Lee began.  ”The debate is not in order,” Biden interrupted. Again, the congresswoman lacked a senator’s signature. 1:28 P. M.: Arizona’s Rep. Raul Grijalva rose to object after North Carolina’s tally. He tried to object on violations of the Voting Rights Act, but Biden shut him down. As you may have guessed, he didn’t have the signature of a senator. Once he gave up, Jackson Lee tagged him out and tried to object to the votes herself. They cut off her microphone, too.  ”There is no debate. There is no debate. There is no debate,” a visibly agitated Biden said as he gaveled.   1:31 PM: Jackson Lee made another appearance minutes later after South Carolina’s certification.  ”There is no debate in the joint session,” Biden said, shutting her down once more.  1:36 PM: Biden must have thought, after five minutes of peace and getting through the state of West Virginia, that the House members might observe the rules. Lee wasn’t even able to make it through her objection before Biden said, ”There is no debate.”  They cut off her microphone again. 1:37 PM: Wisconsin’s votes had been read. With just Wyoming to go, the finish line was in reach.  Jackson Lee once again tried to make an objection on the grounds of Russian interference in the election. ”The objection cannot be received,” Biden said. 1:38 PM: The final state’s votes had been read. Then entered California Rep. Maxine Waters. Taking a play from her own book    she objected to the certification of George W. Bush’s 2000 election    Waters admitted that she didn’t have a senator’s signature on her objection. ”I wish to ask: Is there one United States senator who will join me in this letter of objection?” Waters asked. Through House Speaker Paul Ryan’s chuckle and boos from the rest of the chamber, it was clear that there was not. 1:40 PM: The states were counted, but three protestors started yelling from the visitors’ gallery of the chamber. At least one of them was reciting the Constitution as he was taken away by security.  Biden did not look thrilled. But at the end of the day, despite the objections, Trump’s election was certified by Congress."
31746,31785,50551,The challenge of covering Trump,CNN,John Avlon,1/6/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Here’s a confession: I was present at the creation. Donald Trump rode down his golden escalator to announce his candidacy about 11 a. m. June 16, 2015. After 45 minutes of rambling divisiveness that included some of his early hits    introducing ”Make America Great Again,” boasting about his wealth and calling Mexicans ”rapists”    I was   and ready to do   commentary on CNN.  My   reaction to the man who would be the GOP nominee? ”This is a reality TV show star trying to run to pump up his profile even more because he is drunk on pure ego.” At the end of this surreal and unprecedented election, this still sounds about right to me. The media came under a lot of criticism for underestimating Trump and dismissing his supporters. I always believed he could do well in the primaries. After all, the GOP had been systematically excommunicating its   leaving it susceptible to a hostile takeover from conservative populists who for decades had been pained by economic and cultural change. They weren’t in the mood for a moderate candidate wielding thoughtful policies that could unite the nation. They were ready to fall in love with a defiantly   celebrity strongman.   We’d seen Trump’s political stripes when he was cheerleading the birther conspiracy theory four years earlier. There was little reason to think that he’d suddenly discover a political conscience or deep policy chops. But I mistakenly thought that a master marketer who’d been obsessed with cultivating the press for decades would try to win over the media. Instead, Trump decided to declare war on journalists. The Daily Beast got an early taste of the Trump team’s tactics the month after his announcement, when reporter Tim Mak called Michael Cohen, special counsel to the Trump Organization, to ask about a   deposition from Trump’s first divorce. In it, Trump’s first wife, Ivana, accused him of making her feel ”violated” during sex at the end of their marriage and used the word ”rape” to describe one incident in 1989, according to ”Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump,” by Harry Hurt III. She later retracted the allegation and, during the campaign, said the story was ”totally without merit.” In response to the inquiry, Cohen threatened Mak: ”I will make sure that you and I meet one day while we’re in the courthouse. And I will take you for every penny you still don’t have. And I will come after your Daily Beast and everybody else that you possibly know,” Cohen said. ”So I’m warning you, tread very fucking lightly, because what I’m going to do to you is going to be fucking disgusting. You understand me?” As    of The Daily Beast, I understood well enough to publish Cohen’s threats. Trump then went on CNN to deny that Cohen ever threatened our reporter and to denounce The Daily Beast.  I returned fire the next morning on CNN’s ”New Day,” furious that campaign officials thought they could get away with threatening a reporter. Tone comes from the top of every organization and the fight fell clearly within our mission to confront bullies, bigots and hypocrites. But in subsequent conversations, it quickly became clear that the Trump Organization had been accustomed to silencing critics by threatening to sue. The themes that would dominate much of Trump’s campaign    divisive populist appeals, attacks on the media, legal threats and   behavior towards women    were all apparent, in embryo, during the early weeks of his campaign. The Daily Beast was one of the first news organizations to be blacklisted by the Trump campaign for most of the election cycle. We shared this distinction with The Washington Post, Buzzfeed, Politico and National Review    a testament to Trump’s thin skin. We considered it a badge of honor. The Trump team attacked the media as a way to deflect criticism, distract voters and attempt to avoid being held accountable. Ultimately, all major news organizations    except   outlets like Breitbart, whose CEO, Steve Bannon, became chair of the Trump campaign    were forced to confront the challenge that came from covering Trump. All politicians spin and some lie outright. But analysis showed that Trump lied with such abandon that constant ”reality checks” were required to ensure a   debate.  Reporters work hard to avoid partisan slants. But we have an equal and sometimes competing responsibility to avoid false equivalencies that can come from uncontested ”on the one   the other” coverage. One of the lasting legacies of this campaign may well be the recognition that news organizations need to be relentlessly nonpartisan when it comes to politics but not neutral when it comes to reporting the facts, without fear or favor."
31747,31786,50552,A failure to see the obvious,CNN,Phil Mattingly,1/6/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Michael Steel slipped quietly into CNN’s nearly empty, makeshift Manchester, New Hampshire, bureau looking equal parts exhausted and relieved. Pulling off his winter coat on that freezing February morning, the   veteran GOP operative shook my hand and exhaled for a minute, gathering himself before a television appearance. Jeb Bush, Steel’s boss and the former governor of Florida, had finished fourth in New Hampshire’s crucial     primary. It was, to borrow Jon Huntsman’s infamous 2012 phrase, ”a ticket to ride” further in the campaign. Steel was frustrated that Bush had been edged out for third place by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. But South Carolina was next up, and Bush was well positioned there, he said. I nodded knowingly. ”Definitely,” I replied. ”Big night for you guys. Sets you up well for your South Carolina move.” This, of course, couldn’t have been more wrong. There would be no ”South Carolina move.” Bush would be out of the race    and Steel out of his job as a top adviser    just 10 days later. But my error did not come about because Steel was spinning me (though, as a   communications guy, there was most certainly an element of that). Instead, Steel and I were caught in the same vortex, a trap in which we assumed that the absurdity of the previous six months simply had to end at some point. Normalcy would eventually take over. Campaigns with actual strategies, ground operations and a grasp of election fundamentals would eventually take over. Sanity, in other words, would return. But it wouldn’t. And the inability of the Republican Party’s smartest operatives (of which Steel is one) and most of the media’s smartest reporters (a group to which I don’t belong, but to which plenty of my colleagues do) to grasp that fact in real time is something that will forever define the 2016 cycle. In retrospect, it wasn’t much of a secret. Donald Trump shot to the top of the GOP polls within a few weeks of entering the race. That never changed. Yet we    party operatives and journalists alike    kept searching for reasons he would fall instead of accepting the reality staring us in the face. The energy at the New York billionaire’s rallies was unmatched. His supporters were unrelenting in their support and, more importantly, in their belief in their candidate. When it came to Jeb Bush, he’d just finished fourth in the state he’d bet his entire campaign on. Fourth! That’s terrible! Yet a South Carolina rebound seemed totally plausible to us. It wasn’t. During the primaries, I covered New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (Date of Campaign Death:    New Hampshire) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich (DOCD:    Indiana) with bits of Bush (DOCD:    South Carolina) Cruz (DOCD:    Indiana) and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida (DOCD:    Florida). My producer and I jokingly called ourselves Team Grim Reaper    whichever campaign we began to cover seemed to face imminent death. But we had a fascinating,   and   view of some the Republican Party’s greatest hopes, smartest players and best advisers. Few, if any, detected their demise before it was too late. From the outside, it appeared like the movie ”Groundhog Day,” in which the protagonist lives through the same day again and again. Each campaign and candidate continued to come up with increasingly unlikely pathways to try to beat Trump. But they were unable to remove themselves from the alternate universe they inhabited    a universe in which primary voters wanted to hear about issues and policies. One adviser, who shall remain nameless to protect his profanity, put it plainly over beer one night following a GOP debate. He ticked through policy after policy on which Trump had diverged from Republican orthodoxy, quote after quote in which Trump had offended large segments of the population, regardless of party. Then he paused and, in a departure from months of relentless optimism and constant spin, admitted that the writing was finally on the wall for his boss. Staring into his Sam Adams in disbelief, he mumbled: ”What the fuck happened?” There’s no question Trump tapped into something profound, and journalists and historians will expound on that for years to come. But from a pure campaign perspective, nothing struck me more than watching the professionals collapse as Trump’s campaign    short on infrastructure,   donors, consultants and well, much of anything else that traditional campaigns rely on    proved both agile and unrelenting in its (extraordinarily unorthodox) pursuit of victory. It wasn’t a secret that Trump’s tactics were working. It’s just that nobody was willing to believe it."
31748,31787,50553,Trump’s GOP opponents left too much to chance,CNN,Kevin Madden,1/6/17,2017,1,," (CNN) I have worked on three Republican presidential campaigns, and they all had one common strategic imperative: When it comes to defining your opponent, don’t leave anything to chance. For some reason, Donald Trump’s primary opponents decided to challenge this rule. The Jeb Bush campaign offered a case study on this. Early in the campaign, when NBC’s Chuck Todd asked where he got his military advice, Trump responded: ”I watch the shows.” It’s hard to think of a more disqualifying remark coming from a candidate in a Republican presidential primary.  As part of my work offering   commentary, I regularly talked to communications and political staff on the GOP campaigns. When I received a routine updates from Bush’s press shop that merely pointed out Trump’s remarks in an ”in case you missed it” type of way, I was taken aback. Why wasn’t the campaign against Trump more forceful, more sustained? I pressed Bush’s aides to hit Trump for learning about the military on TV, but got nowhere.  My main advice to Bush’s campaign and others battling Trump: Attack his lack of experience and even basic understanding of national security issues. This was a glaring weakness.  A very public effort to exploit it would require their constant attention, given Trump’s domination of media coverage. Where was the long line of national security experts? What were the advertising plans? I expected to hear back from Bush’s campaign with a confident, almost gleeful readout of the plan they were hatching to crush Trump for making this remark. Crickets. Nothing. As a result, the moment  —   the opportunity  —   quickly passed. The media turned its attention to Trump flogging Bush, the opponent he dubbed ”low energy.” Months later, it still boggles my mind that the Bush campaign  —   and all the rest  —   let that opening pass. It was a telling sign. Perhaps they thought the media would do their work for them. Perhaps they feared Trump’s retaliation.  Whatever the reason, Trump’s Republican opponents failed to define him. They broke the rule.  They left it to chance."
31749,31788,50554,Peeking behind the curtain as GOP loyalties shift to Trump,CNN,Sara Murray,1/6/17,2017,1,," (CNN) The Republican National Convention was a rollercoaster ride from the outset. On Monday, we witnessed an open revolt on the convention floor  —   an unsuccessful   attempt to thwart Trump’s nomination. By Tuesday, it was clear an effort to put Sen. Ted Cruz’s name into nomination had sputtered out. And, of course, there was all the side drama. Melania Trump’s plagiarized convention speech. A (successful) effort to sneak Donald Trump’s second wife, Marla Maples, into the convention via a loading dock so she wouldn’t appear in the Trump family box but could still watch her daughter, Tiffany Trump, deliver a speech. And a very public feud between Trump’s   chairman, Paul Manafort, and his ousted campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. Amid all the madness, delegates made it official Tuesday evening: Trump was the Republican nominee for president. The GOP handwringing would continue for months, of course, but by Wednesday night, delegates were beginning to shed their somber        attitudes and embrace the party atmosphere. It finally felt festive! But it was the mayhem that unfolded late Wednesday evening that made me realize that the party  —   however begrudgingly  —   had indeed accepted Trump. As Cruz prepared to take the stage and deliver a convention speech, rumors were flying about whether he would finally endorse Trump or snub the newly minted nominee. I made my way through Cleveland’s Quicken Loans Arena and up to the suite level set aside for big GOP donors and elected officials. Trump was hardly a favorite of the party’s moneyed donors. But as they nibbled hors d’oeuvres and sipped champagne and cocktails, many of the donors’ faces appeared shocked as it became clear Cruz was not going to endorse the nominee. He even said, ”vote your conscience,” the rallying cry for   delegates.  As soon as Cruz finished his speech, top GOP fundraisers and elected officials spilled into the hallway  —   some openly enraged. An elected official from Ohio told a top Trump donor that he didn’t even like Trump but was livid at Cruz nonetheless. I was making my way back down to the convention floor when a source informed me I had abandoned the suite level too quickly. I had just missed Cruz, attempting to enter GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson’s skybox. Cruz was rebuffed.  Two months later, Cruz would finally throw his support behind the GOP nominee. It was Trump’s party now."
31750,31789,50555,Evangelicals and Trump: A story of forgiveness,CNN,Maeve Reston,1/6/17,2017,1,," (CNN) I realized Donald Trump could win the presidency on a frosty January morning in Albia, Iowa, 151 hours before the start of the caucuses. Ted Cruz had just sauntered inside Bogie’s Steakhouse, in his barn jacket and cowboy boots, with former Texas Gov. Rick Perry at his side. The event opened with both men bowing their heads in prayer under a mounted   buck (reportedly the largest   buck ever harvested by a hunter).  Moments before, Cruz had insisted to reporters that he was finally seeing conservatives come together because ”the stakes are too high for us to get this choice wrong.” He predicted they would choose the proven conservative, and asked, ”Who’s stood and defended life and marriage and religious liberty?”  But the numbers were telling a different story: Trump was rising among evangelicals. That morning, he had received the   endorsement of Jerry Falwell Jr.  For so long, students of politics thought the key to winning the Republican nomination was a candidate’s ability to win over conservative evangelicals. We had wrongly assumed they would never embrace the   Donald Trump, with his shifting views on abortion and luminous praise for Planned Parenthood.  But lingering at Bogie’s talking to voters as the bleak winter light streamed through the blinds, many   Christian conservatives told me they were wavering between Cruz and Trump.  How could that be? I asked one of them. How could so many evangelicals look beyond Trump’s lifestyle, the way he talked about God and church  —   drinking his ”little wine” and having his ”little cracker.”  He just looked at me, scribbling away at my notes. ”America,” he said, ”is a forgiving nation.” "
31751,31790,50556,Winter storm moves up East Coast,CNN,Eliott C. McLaughlin,1/8/17,2017,1,," (CNN) The winter storm that socked the Southeast has moved up the East Coast, promising heavy snow and frigid temperatures early this week for millions of people in the Northeast. As of late Saturday, Boston had seen a half foot of snow, but the southeast portion of Massachusetts was hit harder, particularly the Cape Cod area. Hanover recorded 17 inches of snow, Middlesboro 16 and East Bridgewater 15.   Parts of New Jersey, New York, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island, Virginia and North Carolina saw 10 inches or more as well.  The town of Barnstable, on the Cape, said   inches of snow could fall per hour and urged residents not to park on the main street because of snowplows.  Going back to work Monday could be treacherous. Temperatures won’t rise above freezing until Tuesday, the National Weather Service said.  As the snow has moved out of the Eastern United States, cold temperatures have rushed in, and residents all along the Eastern Seaboard can expect Sunday highs to be 10 to 20 degrees below normal highs.  Boston Mayor Marty Walsh urged the city’s citizens to look out for each other and help keep the streets cleared. ”If we can all work together to remove the snow rather than push it around, we’ll be in good shape for Monday morning,” he told CNN affiliate WBZ. Travel problems, Thousands of travelers had flights canceled up and down the East Coast because of the winter weather and the shooting at Fort   International Airport in Florida. Alexia Marramarco, a French foreign exchange student on her way back to Georgia State University in Atlanta, was one of them. First, her flight Friday from Paris to Fort Lauderdale was diverted to Miami because of the shooting. Then, after being bused to Fort Lauderdale, Marramarco learned her connecting flight to Atlanta was canceled because of weather. ”I haven’t slept,” she said Saturday. Asked if she thought she’d get back to campus by Saturday night, she said, ”Je ne sais pas.” (”I don’t know. ”) The Fort Lauderdale airport closed one of its four terminals after the shooting but reopened it for flights on Saturday afternoon. FlightAware, an airline tracking website, listed more than 2, 100 cancellations within, into or out of the United States by 6 p. m. ET Saturday. Airports in Boston and Philadelphia urged travelers to check with their carriers about their flight status. The number dropped to fewer than 1, 800 by Sunday afternoon.  Drivers also ran into problems. A pileup involving as many as 20 vehicles shut down a section of Interstate 91 near Middletown, Connecticut, on Saturday afternoon, WBZ reported. No serious injuries were reported. In Virginia, one highway fatality occurred Saturday afternoon when an SUV ran off a road in Greene County, the Virginia State Police said. State police responded to 527 traffic crashes on Saturday. North Carolina State Highway Patrol troopers have responded to nearly 1, 500 calls for service and more than 700 vehicle collisions since midnight. North Carolina, North Carolina took a heavy punch Friday night, with CNN affiliate WRAL reporting that Raleigh saw about 2 inches of snow but surrounding areas, including Orange and Durham counties, got 6 inches or more.  Though snow tapered off Saturday, driving conditions will remain hazardous because of low temperatures and ice on the highways. ”Throughout Monday the weather is going to be pretty cold and whatever is on the road will still be there,” Gov. Roy Cooper said. He said that, so far, there are no   fatalities. Cooper said 9, 300 customers were without power Saturday afternoon, down from 25, 000 earlier in the day. Fewer than 3, 000 remained without power Sunday afternoon, according to Duke Energy.  The weather was so bad in the Triangle area that the Saturday night basketball game between the University of North Carolina and North Carolina State University was postponed until 1 p. m. Sunday. Georgia, The storm that Atlantans were warned about Friday, sending them flocking to the grocery store, didn’t pan out for the most part. Three to 5 inches of snow were predicted, but only a dusting of snow fell on the city, though icy conditions persisted through Sunday and conditions stayed below freezing. Wind chill was also a problem. A motorist was killed Saturday when his car struck a patch of ice on a bridge and he lost control of his vehicle. Authorities said inclement weather and excessive speed contributed to the accident. The storm had knocked out power to more than 10, 000 customers across metro Atlanta by early Saturday, Georgia Power said. All but a few hundred homes and businesses saw their power restored by Sunday afternoon. Florida, It didn’t snow in the Sunshine State, but storms forced the cancellation of the Walt Disney World Half Marathon. This was the 20th anniversary of the event, which was sold out. There was a tornado watch for western Florida, around Tampa. Event organizers in Orlando delayed and then canceled the race because of strong winds and lightning in the area. The West, Four people died in California over the weekend as a series of storms pounded the state. One person died and another was hospitalized after being trapped in a car in the water Sunday morning near the Oakland International Airport, CNN affiliate KRON reported, citing fire officials. Two people died in solo spinout accidents most likely due to the heavy rain in the San Francisco Bay area, California Highway Patrol Officer Custodio Lopez said. ”Both of these accidents are still under investigation so we don’t know for certain it’s from the rain, but they both occurred on wet roadways and were solo spinouts so we believe weather was a factor,”  Lopez said. One accident happened Saturday morning in the Oakland area and the other occurred Saturday night in the Hayward area, Lopez said. A woman was killed Saturday morning after a tree fell on her at the Canyon Lakes Golf Course in San Ramon, authorities there said. Flooding is likely in the coming days, forecasters said. While moderate to heavy storms were predicted to persist through Monday, producing snow in the higher elevations and rising water levels elsewhere, a second storm will pass through the West Coast on Tuesday and Wednesday.  The rain is expected to melt the snow at the higher elevations, which threatens to overload dams and reservoirs in California. All the gates at the Nimbus Dam near Folsom, California, have been opened to let the water flow downstream. Along with heavy rain, the National Weather Service forecast mountain snow in the West over the weekend, with flooding likely across central and Northern California, western Nevada and coastal Oregon. Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval has ”declared a state of emergency due to the severe weather system developing in north Nevada and the possible danger to life and property.” Overall, 24 million people are under a winter weather advisory or warning across the Southeastern United States and in the Northwest, including the Sierras in Northern California.

31752,31791,50557,"Kentucky abortion bills signed, effective immediately",CNN,,1/8/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin on Monday signed two bills that put tighter restrictions on abortion, including one measure prohibiting the procedure at or after 20 weeks of pregnancy.  The bills include an emergency provision, making them effective immediately after Bevin’s signature.  The first, House Bill 2, now requires a physician or technician to perform an ultrasound, describe and display the ultrasound images to the mother, and provide audio of the fetal heartbeat to the mother before she may have an abortion.  The text of the bill says the pregnant woman may choose to avert her eyes from the images, and request the volume of the heartbeat be turned down or off. The second measure, Senate Bill 5, prohibits abortions in the state at or after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The bill would not apply in cases where an abortion is required to save the life of the mother or prevent serious risk of bodily harm to the mother, but it does not contain exceptions for cases of rape or incest. The measures passed the   state Legislature on Saturday.  In a press release, Bevin said: ”This is truly a new day in Kentucky,” after signing the two bills, along with five other measures covering matters including labor unions and their membership. The American Civil Liberties Union immediately filed a lawsuit on Monday over the ultrasound measure, and is awaiting a judge’s decision. ”We’ve requested an emergency temporary restraining order,” said Amber Duke, communications director ACLU of Kentucky. The ACLU of Kentucky and the ACLU Foundation filed the legal challenge on behalf of Kentucky’s sole licensed outpatient abortion facility, EMW Women’s Surgical Center, three physicians, and their patients, according to the ACLU. In a statement, Planned Parenthood Federation of America President Cecile Richards said the   ban ”is not just shameful    it’s dangerous for women.” ”A woman has the right to make her own personal, private decisions about her health and medical care. This bill takes that right away,” she said. ”Make no mistake    Kentuckians flat out reject these abortion bans and attacks on reproductive health care.” Ingrid Duran, director of state legislation for the National Right to Life Committee, was quoted on the organization’s website saying the legislation ”sets a tone for the 2017 session in all states: that the unborn child deserves protection.”"
31753,31792,50558,Video shows moment airport gunman opened fire ,CNN,Eliott C. McLaughlin,1/8/17,2017,1,," (CNN) The gunman walks through the baggage claim area at Fort   International Airport, just steps behind a man and two boys. As coolly as one might check a cell phone for messages, he pulls a handgun from his waistband and begins firing, then quickly runs off camera.  Security footage obtained by TMZ shows the seconds before and after a gunman police say was Esteban Santiago opened fire at the airport Friday. As the silent video begins, it shows what could be any baggage claim area in America.  People tugging suitcases behind them pass baggage carts and carousels. The gunman, wearing a blue sweater with black stripes on the shoulders and carrying a jacket in his left hand, enters the screen, draws the weapon with his right hand and appears to fire it three times.  A couple sitting nearby drops to the ground. A woman ducks behind a baggage cart. Several people, seeing nowhere to take cover, dive   to the ground.  Reached for comment on the footage, airport spokesman Greg Meyer said, ”We are aware of the video on TMZ. There is currently an investigation involving law enforcement looking into the matter.” The Broward County Sheriff’s Office could not be immediately reached for comment.  Santiago confessed to planning the assault that killed five people and left several others wounded, according to a criminal complaint filed by federal prosecutors.  Two of the injured victims remained in intensive care Sunday afternoon, while the remaining four had been released or were recovering at Broward General Hospital, Sheriff Scott Israel said. The hospital gave slightly different numbers, saying seven victims, five of them suffering gunshot wounds, remained hospitalized Sunday. One gunshot victim was released Saturday, the hospital said.  Asked if passengers would experience added security at the airport, Israel said he was more concerned with persuading lawmakers to keep firearms out of the hands of felons, the mentally ill and those on   lists.  ”The answer isn’t to beef up airports,” he said. ”We’re a free society. We as Americans, we go to airports and stadiums and venues every day of our lives.” Gun had been confiscated, Federal authorities were familiar with Santiago. He’d set off red flags just weeks ago.  He visited an Alaska FBI office in November, saying his mind was being controlled by US intelligence. He left a gun in the car.  (Previously, authorities said Santiago also left a newborn in the car, but Anchorage FBI spokeswoman Staci   walked that back Sunday, saying Santiago had his child with him when he walked into the FBI office, and ”the child was in constant custody and care of the FBI, inside our facility, until his mother retrieved him. ”) The Army veteran’s rambling   interview at the Anchorage office was concerning enough for authorities to take away his gun and order a mental health evaluation. But it wasn’t enough to get him mentally adjudicated, which would have prohibited Santiago from owning a firearm. Santiago got the gun back a month later when he retrieved the pistol from police headquarters, and it was that weapon, law enforcement sources told CNN, that he used in the airport attack.  ”As far as I know, this is not somebody that would have been prohibited based on the information that (authorities in Alaska) have. I think that law enforcement acted within the laws that they have,” said US Attorney Karen Loeffler. Santiago also had some legal trouble and was due in court in March. Complaint: He aimed for heads, Santiago, 26, faces three federal charges that each carry the possibility of the death penalty, the US Justice Department said.  He will be charged Monday with counts of causing serious bodily injury to someone at an international airport using a firearm during and in relation to a violent crime and causing the death of a person through the use of a firearm. Santiago told investigators he bought a   ticket to Fort Lauderdale and brought a Walther 9 millimeter pistol and two magazines. He said he went into a bathroom stall at the airport, loaded the gun and shot the first people he saw, according to the criminal complaint. He thinks he fired 15 bullets, aiming at his victims’ heads, the complaint says. Santiago recently began selling his possessions, including his car. Friends and associates noticed more erratic behavior, investigators have learned from interviews with those who know him.  Authorities are examining writings, including online posts, that appear to indicate some period of planning, law enforcement officials said. George Piro, the FBI’s special agent in charge in Miami, said Santiago flew from Anchorage to Minneapolis to Fort Lauderdale. A lieutenant with the Anchorage airport police said Santiago had one checked bag    a handgun case containing a pistol.  Though authorities do not yet know Santiago’s motive, the FBI has not ruled out terrorism, Piro said, adding that the suspect was cooperating with investigators, who spent several hours interviewing him.  Broward County Mayor Barbara Sharief said law enforcement has told her that Santiago ”had some contact here in terms of family members” and had visited Fort Lauderdale and Miami in the past. However, she said, police have told her that Friday’s shooting was a random attack.  ’His mind was not right’ Santiago lived in Alaska, where he was a security guard. In January 2016, he was arrested and charged with assault and criminal mischief after an argument with his girlfriend in Anchorage, according to court documents. Santiago yelled at his girlfriend while she was in the bathroom, then broke down the door, according to the complaint. The woman told investigators that Santiago tried to strangle her and struck her in the side of the head, the complaint said. Santiago left before police arrived. Anchorage municipal prosecutor Seneca Theno said Santiago pleaded no contest. Under a deferred prosecution agreement, the charges would have been dismissed if he complied with the conditions. He was due back in court March 28. The military said Santiago’s nine years of service in the National Guard included one   tour in Iraq, where he was awarded a combat action badge.  ’He had visions’ Santiago returned from Iraq a changed man, his aunt told CNN.  ”His mind was not right,” Maria Ruiz Rivera said. ”He seemed normal at times, but other times he seemed lost. He changed.” She added, ”He talked about all the destruction and the killing of children. He had visions all the time.” Ruiz said she lost contact with her nephew several months ago. ”He stopped calling,” she said. ”He wouldn’t respond to my messages. I would call and text. He seemed distant.” Her family is still in shock, she said. ”Who would have imagined that he could do something like this?” she said. ”I don’t say that because we’re family. I say it because he wasn’t like that.” The suspect’s brother, Bryan Santiago, said he believes the shooting rampage resulted from mental issues that surfaced after his time in Iraq. Esteban Santiago requested medical help from army and federal agencies, according to his brother. He received some treatment. Bryan Santiago said he used to speak with his brother regularly, but the communication ceased about a month ago. The victims, Terry Andres of Virginia Beach, Virginia, was at the airport to begin a vacation with his wife, Ann, and his 63rd birthday was coming up, according to a close friend. Andres died, and his wife was uninjured, said the friend, who asked to remain anonymous. ”Terry was the kindest, sweetest and best kind of friend anyone could have. He was the ultimate family man,” said the friend, who has known Andres since high school. ”He and Ann were married for 40 years, and he absolutely adored his children and grandchildren.” Another victim was Olga Woltering, 84, who was traveling with her husband, Ralph. They had traveled from their home outside Atlanta for a cruise.  The   and loyal church member died, and her husband escaped serious injury, according to posts on social media. ”Olga was one of the most joyful, loving, caring and committed people I have ever met,” the Rev. Fernando   of the Catholic Church of the Transfiguration in Marietta, Georgia, told CNN. The Wolterings had been members of the church since 1978, the priest said. Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa identified another slain victim as Michael Oehme of Council Bluffs. In a Twitter post, Grassley also said Oehme’s wife, Kari, was wounded in the shooting.  ”Pray as I will for Oehme family of CouncilBluffs Iowa   Michael was killed and Kari the mother was wounded at FtLauderdale Massacre,” the tweet says. A fourth victim was identified as    Shirley Timmons, according to her grandson Steve Reineccius, who called her ”an amazing daughter, wife, mother and grandmother.” Timmons had been married for 51 years to her high school sweetheart, and ”together they built a close, loving family with their three daughters, three    and eight grandchildren. For Shirley, family meant vacations, football games and holiday traditions,” Reineccius said in a statement. "
31754,31793,50559,College Football Championship: Everything you need to know ,CNN,,1/7/17,2017,1,," (CNN) The College Football Playoff National Championship game is coming up Monday. Other than being a mouthful to say    it needs something elegant, like Super Bowl    it should be a great game. Expect a clash, of both titans and colors, as the Alabama Crimson Tide and the Clemson Tigers vie for the title. Here’s everything, and we mean everything, you need to know about the game.  What time is it? Kickoff is at 8 p. m. ET Monday.  What channel is it on? The game will be broadcast on ESPN, and if you don’t have cable, you can catch it on WatchESPN, the channel’s streaming service.  Where is it? The game will be played at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida.  What team usually plays there? The stadium is home to the NFL’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which explains the giant pirate ship in it.   Who’s playing? The Alabama Crimson Tide (in crimson, obviously) will take on the Clemson Tigers (in white, with orange helmets, according to Bleacher Report).  What schools do they represent and where are they?  The University of Alabama is in Tuscaloosa, and Clemson University is in Clemson, South Carolina.  Do these teams have history? Boy, do they ever. This game is a rematch of the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship, which Alabama won  .  Who are the quarterbacks?  Keep these names handy: The Alabama quarterback is Jalen Hurts, and Clemson’s is Deshaun Watson.  Who are the coaches? Nick Saban coaches Alabama, and Dabo Swinney coaches Clemson. More on this later.  What’s the spread?  According to Bleacher Report, Alabama is favored by six points (the same number as a touchdown) with the total points at 51. We told you this would be good.  How many championships has Alabama claimed? 16, including four under current coach Nick Saban. That’s a lot.  Yeah, they’re a pretty big deal.  How many championships has Clemson claimed? One, in 1981.  Can I get tickets, and how much will they set me back?  It’s going to cost you    plenty: Tickets for the game start at $895 apiece on Stubhub.  The really baller sideline seats are going for as much as $50, 000, which is about what it costs to get a   education at either Alabama or Clemson.  Everyone keeps talking about the SEC. I don’t know what that is and at this point, I’m too afraid to ask.  Division I FBS teams are divided into conferences. Think of them like leagues. Alabama belongs to the Southeastern Conference, or the SEC. It is the most powerful conference and one of the reasons it seems like everyone in the South is crazy about football.  Clemson is in the Atlantic Coast Conference, which is also pretty good.  Why is Alabama’s mascot an elephant if the team is called the Crimson Tide?  This is actually a great story, as related by Alabama’s athletics website. Basically, during a   1930 game between Alabama and Ole Miss, the Alabama team came out with such strength and force, fans yelled, ”Hold your horses, the elephants are coming!” and the name ”Red Elephants” stuck amongst sportswriters.  How do you pronounce Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney’s name? It’s     as in ”doing the dab.” Someone should call him ”The Dab.” His real name is William Christopher Swinney.   Who is Lane Kiffin, and why does anyone care?  Kiffin was the offensive coordinator for Alabama and was slated to leave the school at the end of the season to coach another team. However, Saban, Alabama’s head coach and a god among football men, recently made the surprising announcement that Kiffin would not be sticking around to coach during the championship game. Drama ensued.  What should I yell out the car window if I want to proclaim my allegiance to one of these teams?  If you’re into Alabama, you only need to know two words: Roll Tide. This is suitable for any occasion, up to and including wills and marriage vows.  If you’re rooting for Clemson, a hearty ”Go Tigers” will suffice.  What does the trophy look like, and is it better than the crystal football egg thing teams used to get? The trophy looks like this: It’s not better than the old trophy, which looked like it belonged in the throne room of Buckingham Palace.  What are some other fun facts I can use to sound smart?   Clemson had an undefeated 2015 season going into last year’s championship game and then lost to Alabama. This year, it’s Alabama that’s been undefeated so far. Does that mean anything? Who knows?  This is also the first time two teams have met for a rematch of a Division I College Football Championship, made even more interesting (or boring, perhaps) because, well, they just played each other last year!  Now you know everything there is to know about Monday night’s game. Enjoy."
31755,31794,50560,Ethics office: Trump nominees still not properly vetted,CNN,Eugene Scott,1/7/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Several of   Donald Trump’s Cabinet nominees have still not been properly vetted less than one week before hearings begin on Capitol Hill, the Office of Government Ethics said in a letter to Democratic senators Friday. ”The announced hearing schedule for several nominees who have not completed the ethics review process is of great concern to me,” wrote Walter M. Shaub, director of the Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to New York Sen. Chuck Schumer and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. ”This schedule has created undue pressure on OGE’s staff and agency ethics officials to rush through these important reviews.” Shaub, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, said his office hasn’t received initial drafts from some nominees. ”I am not aware of any occasion in the four decades since OGE was established when the Senate held a confirmation hearing before the nominee had completed the ethics review process,” he said. However in 2001, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee held a confirmation hearing on Education Secretary Rod Paige eight days before receiving his OGE paperwork. The nominees in question, according to a Senate Democratic source, are Trump’s pick to lead Department of Homeland Security, John Kelly Education   Betsy DeVos Commerce   Wilbur Ross and Ben Carson, whom Trump has tapped to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Nominees who are appointed by the President to positions that require Senate confirmation have to obtain OGE’s certification of their financial disclosure reports. And nominees must also ”make current” their financial disclosure reports by the date of the hearing, added Shaub, who said it would be ”cause for alarm” if the Senate proceeded with hearings before OGE has certified nominees’ reports.  The letter was released by Schumer’s office, and the Senate Democratic leader blasted Trump’s transition team and Senate Republicans over the matter. ”The Office of Government Ethics letter makes crystal clear that the transition team’s collusion with Senate Republicans to jam through these cabinet nominees before they’ve been thoroughly vetted is unprecedented,” Schumer said. ”The Senate and the American people deserve to know that these cabinet nominees have a plan to avoid any conflicts of interest, that they’re working on behalf of the American people and not their own bottom line, and that they plan to fully comply with the law. Senate Republicans should heed the advice of this independent office and stop trying to jam through unvetted nominees. ”​ Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office declined to comment Saturday. The Trump transition team responded Saturday, saying all of the nominees are qualified and expressing disappointment in the push back from Democrats.   ”  Trump is putting together the most qualified administration in history and the transition process is currently running smoothly. In the midst of a historic election where Americans voted to drain the swamp, it is disappointing some have chosen to politicize the process in order to distract from important issues facing our country. This is a disservice to the country and is exactly why voters chose Donald J. Trump as their next president.”"
31756,31795,50561,Is ’Hillary Clinton for mayor’ crazy talk?,CNN,Errol Louis,1/8/17,2017,1,," (CNN) If there’s any glimmer of truth to the rumors that Hillary Clinton is considering a run for mayor of New York City, it would be evidence that she might have tripped and bumped her head during one of those long walks she’s been taking in the woods of Westchester County. It’s not that she couldn’t make a credible run. Clinton is enormously popular among city voters, who came out for her in overwhelming numbers during two runs for US Senate and two more for president. The incumbent mayor, progressive Bill de Blasio, enters this election year with a   51% approval rating, giving rise to the idea that he could be beaten by a fellow Democrat. But as the common political expression goes, you can’t beat somebody with nobody, and only a handful of   local officials have declared they will run against de Blasio.  In truth, it appears that the chatter about a Clinton candidacy started as a bit of mischief cooked up by   publications like Newsmax and the New York Post, the latter of which published an editorial urging Clinton to run, while openly acknowledging its true agenda: to keep de Blasio from coasting to a second term unopposed (”He needs to be challenged, indeed needs to be replaced,” the paper said).  But it’s safe to assume that nobody in her right mind    certainly, nobody as familiar with the workings of government and politics as Clinton    would lightly take on the headaches of the nation’s largest city for such nakedly political reasons. And while Clinton isn’t likely to seek another shot at higher office, she’s surely aware that serving at City Hall has been a frustrating,   feat for one promising politician after another. Start with the fact that our city has 8. 4 million people crammed into 322 square miles. If we were a separate state, we’d rank 11th in terms of population, smaller than the state of New Jersey but larger than Virginia. We’re the quintessential city of immigrants, with 37% of our residents    more than 3 million people, about the number of people in Chicago    who aren’t American citizens. And we’re a city of economic extremes, home to Wall Street and more billionaires (79) than any city on earth, and also home to the poorest congressional district in America and host to more than 60, 000 homeless people in shelters on any given night. The city runs 11 public hospitals and America’s largest school system, with 1. 1 million kids who speak a dizzying 180 languages at home. More than 400, 000 people live in the city’s public housing developments    a     that is larger than Oakland, California Minneapolis St. Louis or Orlando. The mayor attempting to steer this vast enterprise is only one player in a local government with an $82 billion budget and unique, frustrating complexities. The city itself is an amalgamation of five counties (called boroughs) each with its own independently elected district attorney. The five prosecutors often treat crimes differently, so the same offense that might result in a ticket and small fine in the Bronx could result in a jail sentence in Manhattan. The subway system    the city’s lifeline, carrying nearly 6 million people a day    is actually owned and run by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which is controlled by the governor of New York. But most New Yorkers mistakenly believe the mayor runs the subway, and he inevitably gets blamed when the trains are late, crowded, dirty or dangerous. Ditto for the roads and bridges. Only one of the city’s five boroughs is geographically part of the mainland of the United States, but many of the   bridges in our city of islands are actually operated by the MTA or the Port Authority, which is run by the state governments of New York and New Jersey. Guess who gets the blame for potholes or traffic jams on those bridges? Being mayor of New York is, in part, a running series of deals and duels with 51 city council members, five party leaders (one for each borough) a dozen members of congress, 212 state legislators    and one powerful governor who has the power to make any mayor’s life miserable. The whole scrum takes place in the nation’s media capital and the home of the United Nations, giving national and international visibility to local disputes. Every New York mayor emerges from the experience with lasting political baggage. John Lindsay in 1972 and Rudy Giuliani in 2008 were   mayors who at first were seen as formidable contenders for the White House but soon fizzled. Ed Koch in the 1980s and Mike Bloomberg in the 2000s each served three terms and openly considered running for president, but never pulled the trigger. New York, so heavy on immigrants and elites, so filled with homeless and hedge funds, produces mayors who are forceful but tolerant, welcoming to immigrants (including undocumented ones) and accustomed to playing hardball with political rivals.  A successful mayor is also adept at striking deals that tax the very rich to benefit the very poor while allowing a wide range of lifestyles and culture to thrive in close quarters. It’s a formula that works well in New York, but rubs many outside the city the wrong way. All of which will surely come into play if Clinton gives serious consideration to replacing de Blasio. My guess is that she’ll shudder at the thought, and keep strolling through the woods toward whatever life has in store for her."
31757,31796,50563,Unrest in Ivory Coast as soldiers demand pay,CNN,Laura Smith-Spark,1/7/17,2017,1,,"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) Amid unrest in cities across the nation, Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara announced Saturday the government reached an agreement with soldiers who have been demanding pay bonuses. Some of the soldiers said they were promised    but never received    a salary bonus for their role in bringing Ouattara to power after disputed elections in 2010, a military source told CNN. Following a meeting Saturday with Ivory Coast Defense Minister   Donwahi and the soldiers, Ouattara announced the agreement and asked soldiers to return to their barracks. But a government military source told CNN some mutinying soldiers in Bouaké rejected the agreement and started firing around the house where the negotiations took place. The soldiers said they want written proof they will be paid, the source said. The unrest began Friday in Bouaké, but gunfire then broke out in the cities of Man in the west and Korhogo and Odienné in the north, as soldiers took up positions at the entrance to each city with heavy weapons, the military source said. The unrest spread Saturday to Abidjan, where soldiers set up roadblocks around the neighborhood of Palmeraie. So far, there have been no reports of anybody being shot or killed. The soldiers, including some who have been demobilized, say they were each promised 5 million CFA francs ($8, 000) and a house for their role in the rebellion that brought Ouattara to power after his predecessor refused to acknowledge his election win. A government source told CNN on Friday that the government did give salary bonuses to the heads of the rebellion and it was not distributed to regular soldiers    although he did not specify the details of what was paid.  The unrest comes amid political reshuffles in the Cabinet and several government institutions. Ivory Coast suffered months of violence following the disputed presidential elections in November 2010. Laurent Gbagbo, the incumbent, refused to step down after Ouattara was declared the winner.  Gbagbo was arrested five months later and is on trial at the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands. A UN peacekeeping force remains in Ivory Coast, tasked with ensuring the protection of civilians and supporting the government’s efforts to disarm and reintegrate former combatants."
31758,31797,50564,Fort Lauderdale suspect’s gun once held by police,CNN,Evan Perez,1/7/17,2017,1,," (CNN) When Esteban Santiago was in an Alaska FBI office in November, saying his mind was being controlled by US intelligence, he left a gun in his car. Clarification: This story has been updated to reflect the latest information from authorities about Santiago’s visit to the FBI office in November. Officials initially said Santiago had left his newborn child in the vehicle along with a firearm. But the FBI corrected that assertion on Sunday, saying  the infant was not left in the car. ”The child was in constant custody and care of the FBI, inside our facility, until his mother retrieved him,” said Staci   a spokeswoman for the Anchorage FBI office. Santiago’s rambling   interview at the Anchorage office was concerning enough for authorities to take away his gun and order a mental health evaluation.

I think that law enforcement acted within the laws that they have,” said US attorney Karen Loeffler.  Santiago got the gun back a month later when he retrieved the pistol from police headquarters, and it was that weapon, law enforcement sources told CNN, that he used to shoot 11 people Friday at the airport in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Santiago also had some legal trouble and was due in court again in March. But he hadn’t been convicted of a serious crime.  ”He hadn’t been adjudicated a felon and he hadn’t been adjudicated mentally ill,” former FBI assistant director and CNN senior law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes said. ”So again, you know we have this situation where he slipped through the cracks.” Here is what we know about the shooter, the victims and the facts of the case: Who is Esteban Santiago? Law enforcement officials have identified Santiago, 26, as the suspect in the five deaths at Fort   International Airport. Santiago faces three federal charges that each carry the possibility of the death penalty, the US Department of Justice said Saturday.  He will be charged Monday with counts of causing serious bodily injury to someone at an international airport using a firearm during and in relation to a violent crime and causing the death of a person through the use of a firearm. Santiago confessed to planning the attack, according to a criminal complaint filed by federal prosecutors. Santiago told investigators he bought a   ticket to Fort Lauderdale and brought a Walther   pistol and two magazines. He said he went into a bathroom stall at the airport, loaded the gun and shot the first people he saw, according to the criminal complaint. He shot all the rounds in one magazine and then used the other, the document says.  He thinks he fired 15 bullets, aiming at his victims’ heads, the complaint says.  Investigators believe the attack plan developed over a period of time, law enforcement officials told CNN on Saturday. Santiago recently began selling his possessions, including his car, and friends and associates noticed more erratic behavior, investigators have learned from interviews with those who know him.  Authorities are examining writings, including online posts, that in retrospect appear to indicate some period of planning, law enforcement officials said. George Piro, the FBI’s special agent in charge in Miami, said Santiago flew from Anchorage to Minneapolis to Fort Lauderdale on a Delta Air Lines flight.  A lieutenant with the Anchorage airport police said Santiago had one bag    a handgun case with a pistol inside that he checked.  Esteban lived in Alaska, where he was a security guard. In January 2016, Santiago was arrested and charged with assault and criminal mischief after an argument with his girlfriend in Anchorage, according to court documents that CNN obtained. At the time, Santiago allegedly yelled at his girlfriend while she was in the bathroom, according to the complaint. He then broke down the bathroom door. The woman told investigators that Santiago strangled her and struck her in the side of the head, the complaint said. Santiago left before police arrived. Anchorage municipal prosecutor Seneca Theno said Santiago pleaded no contest to criminal mischief and assault charges.

Esteban Santiago requested medical help from army and federal agencies, according to his brother. He received some treatment. Bryan Santiago, in an interview in Peñuelas, Puerto Rico, said he used to speak with his brother regularly but the communication ceased about a month ago. What was the motive? The FBI has not ruled out terrorism, Piro said, but Israel cautioned it was early in the investigation and authorities did not know Santiago’s motive. Saturday, Piro said investigators ”continue to look at the terrorism angle” as a possible motive.  ”We have not ruled out anything,” he said. ”We continue to look at all avenues, all motives.”  Piro said Santiago was cooperating with investigators, who interviewed him for several hours. The interview concluded early Saturday. The victims, Terry Andres of Virginia Beach, Virginia, was at the airport to begin a vacation with his wife, Ann, and a celebration for the couple    his 63rd birthday was coming up, according to a close friend. Andres died his wife was uninjured, said the friend, who asked to remain anonymous. ”Terry was the kindest, sweetest and best kind of friend anyone could have.

31759,31798,50565,10 most damning findings from report on Russian election interference,CNN,Eugene Scott,1/7/17,2017,1,," (CNN) The US intelligence community concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an ”influence campaign” to harm Hillary Clinton’s chances of winning the 2016 election. The declassified reported, released Friday, determined with ”high confidence” that Russia’s interference    consisting of hacking Democratic groups and individuals and releasing that information via   websites, including WikiLeaks    helped   Donald Trump win the election. Here are some of the highlights from the report. 1. Goal was to undermine US faith in democratic process, ”We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for   Trump.” 2. Effort was ordered by Putin, ”We assess that influence campaigns are approved at the highest levels of the Russian government   particularly those that would be politically sensitive.” 3. Putin’s grudge, ”Putin most likely wanted to discredit Secretary Clinton because he has publicly blamed her since 2011 for inciting mass protests against his regime in late 2011 and early 2012, and because he holds a grudge for comments he almost certainly saw as disparaging him.” 4. A ’significant escalation’ ”Russian efforts to influence the 2016 US presidential election represent the most recent expression of Moscow’s longstanding desire to undermine the   liberal democratic order, but these activities demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations.” 5.

31760,31799,50566,Fort Lauderdale victims include grandparents,CNN,AnneClaire Stapleton,1/7/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Their lives ended suddenly, tragically, in a storm of gunfire at Fort   International Airport.   But those who died in the shooting Friday filled their lives up until that moment with love, ambition and achievement. One of the five slain victims has not been publicly identified. Here is what we know so far about the other four: Terry Andres  Terry Andres, 62, of Virginia Beach, Virginia, and his wife of nearly 40 years flew into Fort Lauderdale on the way to a Caribbean cruise, the first leg of a vacation that would include both of their birthdays, a daughter, Ryan Kim, told CNN.  Ann Andres turned 62 on Monday she was uninjured in the shooting. Terry Andres’ birthday would have been January 20.  ”My parents could look at each other and you could tell they loved and adored each other,” Kim, 37, of Virginia Beach said. ”Year 1, year 39, it was the same.” The couple married on September 10, 1977, after an electric Christmas Eve date eight months earlier.  Kim said her mother came home after that date and called a friend to say: ”I just went out with the guy that I’m going to marry.” And after many years of marriage, Andres would still declare: ”Your mom is so beautiful,” when she walked into a room.  A New Jersey native, he was just as adoring and emotive with his family and his three grandchildren. He took his two granddaughters on bike rides along the oceanfront and played games of UNO with them for hours.  Kim said one of her daughters recently asked: ”Who’s going to play UNO with us now?” ”His family literally was everything to him,” Kim said. Andres’ youngest daughter, Whitney Rodgers, 34, also lives in Virginia Beach.  His granddaughters called him Poppy. Kim’s friends called him Dad. ”Our friends are devastated because this is like losing a father,” Kim said. Andres worked at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for more than 20 years.  He had a ”a jovial face,” and easily made friends on his many work trips, Kim said. After their Caribbean cruise, the couple planned to head to Mexico for a   vacation.  Kim said her mother told her she is ”100% at peace because they had a fantastic relationship. . ..They had the utmost respect for one another.” Kim added: ”I’m blessed to even have known him. This world was bigger with him in it and it’s smaller now that he’s gone.” Michael Oehme, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa identified one victim as    Michael Oehme of Council Bluffs and said his wife, Kari Oehme, was wounded in the shooting.  ”Pray as I will for Oehme family of CouncilBluffs Iowa   Michael was killed and Kari the mother was wounded at FtLauderdale Massacre,” Grassley said on Twitter. The couple were at the airport preparing for a Caribbean cruise that was slated to begin Saturday, according to CNN affiliate WOWT. Kari Oehme, 52, suffered a shoulder wound and is expected to recover, her    told WOWT.  Adam Angeroth, who has known the couple for eight years and is Kari Oehme’s hairdresser, told the station the couple went on cruises every year and that he had just done her hair and nails in preparation for the trip.  Kari Oehme works for CommScope, a telecommunications company, across the Missouri River in Omaha, Nebraska. The company released a statement saying it was doing everything it can to help the Oehme family.  ”Our deepest sympathy goes out to everyone affected by this tragic event,” the statement said.  Shirley Timmons, Shirley Timmons, 70, was a family woman whom her grandson described as ”an amazing daughter, wife, mother and grandmother.” Her husband of 51 years was her high school sweetheart. They met in eighth grade, said Steve Reineccius, Timmons’ grandson.  ”Together they built a close, loving family with their three daughters, three    and eight grandchildren. For Shirley, family meant vacations, football games and holiday traditions,” he said in a statement. ”She was the most loving, passionate mother who had a love for life and truly sparkled. She will continue to sparkle through her husband, mother, three daughters, and eight grandchildren. She touched many and was loved by all. She will live in our hearts forever and will be truly missed.” Olga Woltering, Olga Woltering and her husband, Ralph, had traveled from their home in Cobb County, Georgia, outside Atlanta, to Fort Lauderdale for a cruise. The      and loyal church member died and her husband escaped serious injury, according to posts on social media. ”Olga was one of the most joyful, loving, caring and committed people I have ever met,” the Rev. Fernando   of the Catholic Church of the Transfiguration in Marietta, Georgia, told CNN. The Wolterings had been members of the church since 1978,   said. ”This is a horrible tragedy for everyone here at Transfiguration, especially because Olga was so loved,” he said. A posting on the church’s website said the couple ”could always be found at 5 p. m. Mass,” and it added, ”Olga was so charming, calling everybody ’Lovey’ or ’Love’ in her unmistakable British accent.”"
31761,31800,50567,Jeff Sessions faces ’Washington’s bloodsport’,CNN,Ariane de Vogue,1/7/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN) Sen. Jeff Sessions is preparing for yet another confirmation hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee.  But this time, he’ll be sitting in the witness chair.  Instead of grilling a potential nominee, Sessions himself will be the main course as he faces his former colleagues Tuesday.  A source familiar with his preparation says Sessions has been working hard since before Christmas on intense prep sessions and while he has spent time this week meeting with senators, he had a   ”murder board” or mock hearing practice on Friday. Lawyers who have worked in the past for the Judiciary Committee are helping him get ready.  Democratic senators are likely to ask him about a broad range of civil rights and civil liberties issues.  Under President Barack Obama, the Department of Justice put an emphasis on issues such as voting rights, LGBT rights and criminal justice reform. If Sessions were to be confirmed as attorney general, he would likely shift Department resources to issues that came up during the campaign, including tougher immigration and drug enforcement. Confirmation hearings are a rite of passage for potential nominees. They can become a blistering showdown with vigorous back and forth that can be the death knell of a nominee. Other times, they feature searching questions and light hearted moments. Every once in a while, they are snoozers.  This will not be a snoozer.  Sessions served for years on the Senate Judiciary Committee. But in 1986, he appeared before the committee himself hoping to get confirmed for a federal judgeship. The hearing did not go well after allegations of racism surfaced.  Footage at the time shows a   Sessions vigorously denying the allegations.  In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash in 2009, Sessions called the experience ”heartbreaking” and added, ”it was not a pleasant event, I gotta tell you.”  ”Charges were thrown out and then you’d try to respond and it just wasn’t able to get the message out. So it was a tough time, it ended up with a    final vote, so I was not moved out of the committee,” he said.  The charges included allegations that Sessions may have called an   lawyer ”boy” and had been critical of the NAACP and ACLU.  Sessions told Bash the charges were ”false” and ”distortions.”  ”I was caricatured in a way that was not me    and my friends knew it,” he said, adding that in the end, he came to peace. ”I resolved that that would not affect me, that the rest of my life was not going to be focused on some event back then, and I would build a new life and go forward and do the right thing,” a journey he said would be helped by the fact that he ended up serving on the Judiciary panel.  On Tuesday, members of the NAACP protested his nomination by staging a   in his Mobile office. The protesters were arrested but they managed to rally Sessions’ critics.  ”Going into the hearings, we are worried that Republican senators are going to give Sen. Sessions a free pass simply because he’s a fellow senator,” said Christopher Kang, the national director of the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans. ”The demonstrations in Alabama showed that people are watching and won’t let that happen,” Kang said.  Sarah Isgur Flores, a spokeswoman for Sessions, said his critics are misrepresenting the senator.  ”Jeff Sessions has dedicated his career to upholding the rule of law, ensuring public safety and prosecuting government corruption,” Flores said in a statement. ”These false portrayals of Sen. Sessions will fail as tired, recycled, hyperbolic charges that have been thoroughly rebuked and discredited.”  This time around, Sessions will marshal not only his past experience as a nominee, but his time serving as senator in an attempt to explain to the American people what he’ll do as   Donald Trump’s attorney general and why his critics are misrepresenting his record. He is armed with pages of testimony from friends and former colleagues. Former Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson    no stranger to confirmation hearings    issued a statement targeting Sessions’ critics before the hearings.  ”He doesn’t have a racist bone in his body. I’ve been an   man for 71 years. I think I know a racist when I see one. Jeff is far from being a racist. He’s a good person, a decent person.” Thompson said.  ’Washington’s bloodsport’ Confirmation hearings haven’t always been so newsworthy. But times, television and twitter have changed all that.  David Ayres, who currently serves as CEO of The Ashcroft Group, helped to oversee numerous confirmation battles when he worked in government both helping to defeat nominees and get them confirmed.  ”It’s Washington’s bloodsport,” he said in an interview. ”It’s like the gladiator going into the arena and the public watching.” His advice? ”Being calm, being human, turning the other cheek, is really something that people appreciate.”  Ayres often reminded nominees that the senators were coming in with their own agendas and causes and it helped to understand them. ”They may have personal issues that they care about, and they are trying to set a tone for the administration, either positive or negative,” he said.  In the olden days, said Paul Collins, professor of legal studies at the University of Massachusetts, the hearings were more pro forma.  ”Nominees didn’t really receive a lot of scrutiny from the Judiciary Committee,” said Collins, the author of ”Supreme Court Confirmation Hearings and Constitutional Change.” ”Rather, their confirmations tended to sail through the process without much difficulty.”  ”The hearings were perfunctory, the senators gave the president the benefit of the doubt and the only the question was ’is he qualified,’ ” said Tom C. Korologos, who worked as a sherpa for nominees starting in the 70s.  ”Now, Congress has made them very ugly and politicized,” he said.  ”They have become a political spectacle where the hearing isn’t about the nominee    it’s about the members of the committee asking questions and making statements. The system has gone awry and it’s a shame.”  Korologos remembers once when he looked a State Department employee in the eye and asked him if there was anything in his record that would embarrass the president.  ”I told him he could bank on being asked about it.”  He said the employee later withdrew because ”I hit a nerve.”  Once, he said, he assisted the hearings for Nelson A. Rockefeller to be vice president. Rockefeller asked him whether his financial disclosure statement would be made public.  Korologos was surprised when Rockefeller expressed concern about his image. Rockefeller said his friends and colleagues ”are going to realize I’m not as rich as they think I am.”  Documents submitted to committee, Whether or not they serve as a proxy war between dueling parties, today there is an established system in place for the hearings.  It starts with document submission. Sessions has submitted thousands of papers. When he failed to mention his previous hearings for the judgeship    an omission seized upon by Democrats and opponents    he immediately sent in supplements.  In a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley on December 23, Sessions said he had ”located, recalled or been made aware of additional items” that were responsive.  There is also the questionnaire. That’s usually about 30 pages long.  Finally, there is the hearing preparation. More often than not they include ”murder boards.”  ”In the murder board sessions, you try to beat up the nominees and ask the hardest thing you can ask,” Ayres said. It gets them ready for the hearing, but it helps the nominee understand if they are having trouble in some area where they need to focus.  ”For the nominee, whether it’s for a judicial position or Senate confirmation, those can be very humbling, humiliating experiences,” he added.  Sessions, who has undoubtedly reviewed the footage of his earlier hearings, will bring his experience to bear this time around.  The hearings are deadly serious but offer the public a glimpse of the person behind the reputation.  Justice Elena Kagan, during her confirmation hearings in 2010, misunderstood a question from Sen. Lindsay Graham. She thought he was asking her a legal question about an attempted terrorist attack that occurred on Christmas Day.  She launched into a complicated answer when he stopped her.  ”I just asked you where you were at on Christmas,” Graham said.  Kagan paused.  ”You know, like all Jews, I was probably at a Chinese restaurant.”  The room erupted into laughter. She was confirmed."
31762,31801,50568,Romney backs Trump’s choice for education secretary,CNN,Sophie Tatum,1/7/17,2017,1,,"Washington (CNN) Mitt Romney publicly backed   Donald Trump’s education secretary nominee in a Washington Post   published Saturday. Betsy DeVos was tapped to lead the Department of Education in Trump’s administration in November, but has been considered a controversial choice by the education community. But Romney    formerly one of Trump’s toughest critics who was later considered to be his secretary of state    pushed back against her opposition and voiced support for her effort to ”challenge the conventional wisdom and the status quo.”  ”The interests opposing DeVos’s nomination charge that charter schools in Michigan    and particularly in Detroit    haven’t lived up to their promise,” Romney said.  Romney    who received DeVos’ endorsement during his 2012 presidential run    noted he has known the Michigan Republican for ”many years,” and said she will do whatever is in the best interest of the nation’s children because, ”as a highly successful businesswoman, DeVos doesn’t need the job now, nor will she be looking for an education job later.”  A firm supporter of charter schools and school voucher programs, DeVos leads the organization American Federation for Children. DeVos has also been outspoken since the nomination to clarify her position against Common Core, despite being associated with several groups that back the program. ”I am truly excited that someone of Betsy DeVos’s capability, dedication and absence of financial bias is willing to take an honest and open look at our schools,” Romney writes.

31763,31803,50570,USSS chief says ’No friction’ with Trump’s private security,CNN,Pamela Brown,1/7/17,2017,1,,"Washingotn (CNN) US Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy wants to set the record straight about   Donald Trump’s private security team and whether it’s causing conflict with his agents. In an exclusive interview with CNN    his first since Trump’s election    Clancy also offered a   look at the unique logistical challenges of providing security for the  ’s large family and securing his New York residence. Most of all, however, he wanted to push back against suggestions that there were conflicts between the Secret Service and the private security team that’s protected Trump for years. Politico reported last month that Trump’s private team ”bristled” at the Secret Service’s desire to take the lead in protecting Trump and in some cases, they had gotten in the way of the agency’s protocols. ”There is no friction at all” with Trump’s private team, insisted Clancy, who said his agency has ”sole responsibility” for protecting the President and the first family. He added that there is no overlap between the private team and his agency. ”They are not in our meetings,” Clancy said. ”They are not armed. They are more of a staff function than a security function. We don’t interact with them.” He explained that while Trump’s private team is there to ensure public events run smoothly and there are no disruptions from the crowd, Secret Service agents are the only ones protecting the  . Although protesters have been a feature of many Trump campaign stops and some have pledged to protest the inauguration, Clancy said that unless a protester is a direct physical threat to the President, the Secret Service will not intervene. ”We want to make sure everyone has their First Amendment rights,” he said, adding that if a protester is removed, that is a decision made by event staff.  Trump has named the head of his private security team, retired NYPD officer Keith Schiller, as his director of Oval Office operations and deputy assistant to the President. Clancy said Schiller serves as a ”conduit for information” between the agents and the   and helps inform the Secret Service about any changes to Trump’s itinerary.  ”He has a larger family. He’s got five children, grandchildren, so that will require more assets, more personnel,” Clancy said. He noted that Trump’s children are ”young adults, so they’re very active, they travel.” But Trump’s Fifth Avenue residence in New York City, Trump Tower    where future First Lady Melania Trump plans to reside through next spring with the couple’s youngest son    presents a different challenge. It’s not unusual for a first lady to be in a different location than the President, Clancy said, but he acknowledged the new Trump arrangement represents a ”longer period of time” than usual    even though his agency would never advise the first family to change their preferred living arrangements.  ”There are enough inconveniences when you take on this role as President and first lady,” Clancy said. ”We don’t want to add to that.”  Trump Tower, The midtown Manhattan building sits on one of the busiest streets in the country. Clancy said the goal is to provide robust security while simultaneously allowing local businesses and residents to continue using the building.  ”We are bringing in more resources” to handle the situation, he said, adding that the Secret Service is working to establish a command post inside Trump Tower that would be ”pretty close to an entire floor.” According to Jared Horowitz, who works for the company responsible for available commercial space at Trump Tower, the floors available to rent    with the average floor space running between 13, 500 to 15, 500 square feet    cost about $1. 5 million a year. Asked about the high price tag, Clancy said they were required by law ”to pay for the property that we need,” adding that the space was ”critical to the protection of the President, so it’s something that needs to be done.”  ”It’s actually no different than what we’ve done with other presidents,” Clancy continued. ”We rented some property in Chicago when President Obama first became president for his trips when he was going out to Chicago. So, this is typically what we do.”  Regarding the government’s negotiations with their new landlord, the Trump Organization, Clancy said, ”They’re very fair with us. They understand the responsibilities we have and they’ve been very accommodating.”               Protecting the President, Clancy, a   veteran of the Secret Service who ran the presidential protection division during the first years of Barack Obama’s presidency, noted there are more similarities than differences among the presidents they protect. ”I don’t think any of them sleep very well,” he said. ”They’re also very  . They all run on tight schedules,” adding that, ”They’re all involved in athletics. Some enjoy golf, some enjoy running, some biking.” In the past year and a half that the Secret Service has been working with Trump, Clancy said he has met with him a couple of times, describing him as ”very gracious and very appreciative” of the Secret Service. Asked how Trump was adjusting to motorcades and having    teams of armed agents guarding him, Clancy said ”it’s unusual for anyone to get used to it, but he has been terrific.”  Threats in the age of Twitter, Two newer areas the Secret Service is focused on are social media and cyberthreats, an area of particular concern given Trump’s frequent use of Twitter and mounting concerns regarding US cybersecurity.  The director said the Secret Service now has a specific division focused on potential social media threats. He also said they are deploying the same experts that provide cyber security for the US financial system in order to ensure that facilities visited by the president are defended from  .  ”Everything keeps me up night,” he said of the array of threats.  But, he added, ”that’s our business.”"

CNN’s Michael Smerconish    who expressed frustration that the presented evidence was heavily classified    told Hayden the report left him ”wanting more.” Hayden said he ”had the same sense of disappointment,” though he ”probably had a little more understanding as to why it was a brick short of a load.” However, Hayden insisted, ”an awful lot of the things we know can’t be shared, because we need to keep going back to this well in the future, Michael, to learn things to keep America safe.” Hayden also urged the American people to have faith in the US intelligence community, even if the details weren’t clear. ”When you’ve got the community coming together and giving ’high confidence’ judgments to these things . .. I certainly have confidence that that’s a true story that was put out there, even though I haven’t been able to see the fine print,” he said. Hayden warned against a partisan reading of the report in light of Trump’s attempts to downplay Russia’s role in the election, including calling the investigation a ”political witch hunt.” ”The criticism of the intelligence community’s judgments on this issue has been that the community is incompetent and politicized and prejudiced and that’s simply not right,” Hayden said. The intelligence community, Hayden insisted, should be ”above the partisan divide.” ”What we’ve seen since the election has been putting the intelligence community right smack in the middle of the middle lane of a hyperpartisan atmosphere here in Washington,” he said. ”Michael, intelligence can’t survive in that lane. It will die.”"

Novak Djokovic ended Andy Murray’s   unbeaten run after a captivating near   struggle under the lights in Doha Saturday to retain his Qatar Open crown. The       scoreline tells only half the story as   Murray saved three match points when Djokovic served for victory in the second set before forcing the decider. The quality of tennis in that second set was breathtaking and Murray, who beat his Serbian rival to win the ATP World Tour Finals at the end of last season, then looked favorite to come out on top again. But Djokovic, who needed treatment for a bleeding finger, dug still deeper and after coming under intense pressure from the Scot on his own service crucially broke to lead  . Serving for the match at   Djokovic fell   down, but retrieved the situation and closed out the match on his fourth championship point. Djokovic, who had produced an escape act of his own to save five match points against Fernando Verdasco in the semifinals, was pleased to return to his best after a disappointing finish to 2016 which saw him lose his top ranking to Murray. ”It means a lot to me because in the last three months of last season I did not feel confident like that,” Djokovic told Eurosport. ”To start the year like that is a dream start,” he added. It was the   ’s first title since the Rogers Cup in Canada last July and he will go to Australia for this defense of the first grand slam title of the season in fine fettle. Murray, who will retain his No. 1 ranking, was beaten by Djokovic in the Australian and French Open finals in 2016 before winning Wimbledon, Olympic gold and the ATP    showpiece event in London to go to top in the world for the first time. He has yet to beat Djokovic in a   match after losing the opening set, but was pleased with his overall performance in becoming the first man to reach the final in Qatar four times. ”It was a great way to start the new year, playing like that,” he said at the trophy presentation.

It was the 19th   performance of Pinturault’s career, but after holding a big advantage after the first leg on the Chuenisbargli piste, was relieved to close out his victory. World Cup overall leader Hirscher was claiming his 100th podium, a mark only surpassed by the great Ingemar Stenmark (155) and was mighty close to adding another win. But Pinturault held on by   of a second to make his own piece of history. ”I thought when I crossed the line it was long enough for me,” he admitted. ”One or two more gates and I would maybe have been behind, but its a very special victory,” he told the official FIS website. Another Austrian, Philipp Schoerghofer, joined Hirscher in the  .

Success at either would be a win for unconventional comedy. Writer and director Maren Ade has conjured one of the better fools in recent memory in Toni Erdmann, the titular character and alter ego of Winfried (Peter Simonischek) a prankster father out to disrupt the life of his careerist daughter Ines (Sandra Hüller). Listless after the death of his dog,   piano teacher and divorcee Winfried travels to Bucharest to surprise his daughter at the doorstep of her office. He waits three hours for her, only to be ignored as she departs with clients.  Ines’ life exists in a bubble where everyone is out to win, and she’s fighting against a thick glass ceiling on her corporate climb. ”You’re an animal!” laughs Ines’ colleague after a meeting. ”Are you even human?” asks her father, dismayed with her driven but evidently unsatisfying life. Needless to say, the    Winfried does not fit in. Merely tolerated by his daughter, she drags him around various networking opportunities, not realizing her irreverent and affable father is more engaging to her clients than she is. Unable to bridge the gap in this filial relationship, Winfried departs, only to reemerge on the Bucharest corporate scene as Toni, international man of mystery, ”life coach” to Ines’ boss and occasional German ambassador. Sporting a black wig, false teeth and a wonky, conspiratorial smile, he’s in his element, ingratiating himself with everyone close to his daughter while Ines, infuriated, is forced to keep schtum through her own embarrassment, lest she reveal their connection.  Stalking Ines’ life and all over her social calendar, Winfried’s fool is just the tonic required, skewering the pretensions of the suits while forcing Ines to embrace her own quashed sense of silliness.  Playing out in a succession of awkward scenarios, Ade and her editing team revel in toying with the audience, letting the camera linger until each scene ripens into   perfection. Things escalate of course, culminating in an impromptu rendition of Whitney Houston’s ”The Greatest Love of All    a literal high note, the song’s lyrics about childhood and   foreshadowing the comedy’s farcical denouement.  Marrying slapstick and aching pathos, Simonischek and Huller’s performances make the ridiculous look sublime    landing laughs and tears in   punches, liberally and with aplomb. It’s all deeply funny and deeply sad, Toni sweetly offers some bitter truths about life, while Ade’s script provides depth without veering towards didacticism. One gets the feeling, like the film itself, ”Toni Erdmann’s” success could prove bittersweet. Hollywood’s proclivity for remakes is unabated, and awards season success might have studios wondering what they could do with a film that thus far has flown under the radar of American audiences. Admittedly, an actor like John Malkovich in Simonischek’s role would be very watchable. It’s all hypothetical of course, but Ade’s touching film should be allowed to percolate for a while longer. Uncomfortable but nevertheless uproarious, ”Toni Erdmann” may not be the comedy we asked for, but it’s the one we needed."

After years of misery, his beloved Oakland Raiders are finally back in the NFL playoffs. ”All the clowning we had to endure over the last decade    that’s over,” the rapper, actor and filmmaker told CNN’s World Sport show ahead of Saturday’s AFC wildcard round clash with Houston Texans. ”You live for these moments, to get in everybody’s faces and let ’em know: ’We back    the Raiders is back.’ It’s good to be in this position, and hopefully we can win a couple of playoff games.” The Raiders last reached the playoffs in the   season, losing in the Super Bowl, and the third of their titles was another two decades before that. ”It was painful, but that’s what I love about sports    I’m a diehard fan, not a   fan,” the    whose real name is O’Shea Jackson, says of his long wait.  ”I was happy with just supporting the team, seeing us grow, seeing us trying to get back on track.” The   ”President of the Raider Nation” has done his part to back the team, recording rap tunes such as ”Come And Get It” to rouse the   fans. ”Music and sports    that’s a marriage made in heaven.

I’m gonna keep chippin’ away.”  The Raiders go to Texas with a     record, and missing the services of injured   quarterback Derek Carr. However, Ice Cube is backing    Connor Cook to shine as he becomes the first rookie quarterback to make his first NFL start in a playoff game in the Super Bowl era. ”It’s going to be tough, but that’s why he’s a professional.

Smerconish, he confessed, had scored just 44. ”My poor results should have prepared me for the disconnect that I felt watching Donald Trump’s ascension to the presidency, compelling evidence of my being out of touch with 46% of the nation,” Smerconish said. ”Mine is a virtual gated community, defined by things like my zip code, or where our kids go to school, my graduate law degree, my political registration as a   my health consciousness.” He added: ”I’m more into ’The Crown’ than ’Duck Dynasty.’ ” It’s a bubble, Smerconish emphasized, that’s at odds with his roots as the ”grandson of Pennsylvania coal crackers.” As a child, he said, his home didn’t have a shower until he was in eighth grade, and his first job, when he was 16, was as a maintenance man at McDonald’s. So this year, he insisted, he intends to be ”better grounded.” ”I have resolved to keep an open ear and be a better listener,” Smerconish insisted. ”You can look for me at Cracker Barrel, shopping at Walmart, driving my   more and my sedan less, maybe even lingering in the parking lot at Eagles home games instead of   all those tailgaters,” he said. ”In 2017, I am out to burst my bubble,” he concluded."
31771,31813,50580,Trump: Only ’stupid’ people think warm ties with Russia are a bad thing,CNN,Eugene Scott,1/7/17,2017,1,," (CNN)  Donald Trump is continuing to resist conclusions reached by US intelligence agencies on Russian involvement in the 2016 election, and on Saturday defended his   belief that closer ties with Russia would be good for the US. Trump’s comments come one day after he received intelligence stating that the Russian government hacked Democratic Party groups and individuals during the election, and that Moscow acted to hurt Hillary Clinton’s campaign to benefit Trump. ”Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. Only ’stupid’ people, or fools, would think that it is bad, We have enough problems around the world without yet another one. When I am President, Russia will respect us far more than they do now and both countries will, perhaps, work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the WORLD!” Trump tweeted. The US intelligence community concluded in a report publicly released Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an ”influence campaign” to harm Clinton’s chances of being elected president. The campaign consisted of hacking Democrats, including Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, before releasing that information via   websites, including WikiLeaks. The intelligence report cited ”a significant escalation” in longtime Russian efforts to undermine the American democratic process.  Trump, however, has insisted Russia did not have an impact on the election results. Earlier Saturday, Trump tweeted, ”Intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results. Voting machines not touched.” Trump said Democrats are focusing on the hacking so intensely out of embarrassment.  ”Gross negligence by the Democratic National Committee allowed hacking to take place. The Republican National Committee had strong defense,” he tweeted Friday night. ”Only reason the hacking of the poorly defended DNC is discussed is that the loss by the Dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed,” Trump added on Twitter. However, the intelligence noted multiple avenues in which Russia attempted to make sure Clinton lost. And the US intelligence community released several new pieces of information to support its conclusions Friday. ”Moscow’s influence campaign followed a Russian messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence operations    such as cyberactivity    with overt efforts by Russian government agencies,   media,   intermediaries and paid social media users or ’trolls,’ ” the report found. Vladimir Putin, and Muscovites, hope Donald Trump will be a friend to Russia, Trump has repeatedly said that he wants to soften the harsh relationship between the US and Russia and has repeatedly praised Putin’s leadership style. On the campaign trail, Trump would often ask ”wouldn’t it be great” if the US and Russia ”got along.”"

The triple world champion was claiming his third straight win in World Cup giant slalom races and making it a   at the Austrian venue, matching Austrian legend Hermann Maier. Ligety, nicknamed ’Ted Shred’ had left his rivals in tatters last year as he won by an astonishing 2. 75 seconds, but this time around he had to settle for a closer margin over second placed Alexis Pinturault of France and home hope Marcel Hirscher. ”I’m super psyched to win this today,” Ligety told the official FIS website after clocking one minute 59. 50 seconds for the two legs.  ”It wasn’t easy conditions on the second run it was dark and bumpy, but any day you win it’s a good day, so I can’t complain.”  Read: Skiing’s winning machine Ligety, Pinturault finished 0. 79 seconds adrift with Hirscher just over a second slower than Ligety, who won the last two races of the   season. ”I hope to be able to have a season close to what I had last year,” Ligety added.  ”But repeating what I did last year in giant slalom is going to be difficult and I don’t expect to be winning the races by the same margins.” Sunday’s race was the start of the journey to the Winter Olympics in Sochi next year and also marked the return of American favorite Bode Miller. The    has not raced for 18 months but despite an unfavorable starting position he was able to finish in 19th place. ”My knee feels better than it has since 2001,” said Miller.  ”Once I made a decision not to race last year, it took a lot of pressure off and I could focus my recovery.” Read: Gut glory at Soelden opener, A massive crowd of 15, 000 watched the proceedings on the Rettenbach Glacier, with the start lowered due to strong winds.

Austrian veteran Benni Raich, a two time Olympic gold medalist and    world champion, dropped back to 13th after being fifth on the first run.

31773,31816,50583,"In January, ’ex’ marks the spot",CNN,Sarah LeTrent,1/9/17,2017,1,," (CNN) There was that   New Year’s kiss at midnight. Valentine’s Day, a holiday based on setting hearts aflutter, was full of awkward pauses and glances over soufflé at the person you used to love.  Come March, it’s time to turn over a new leaf. In recent years, January has earned the nickname ”Divorce Month”    a less appealing title than National Pet Month (May) or National Honey Month (September) though divorce can surely be both hairy and sticky. While marital psychologists and divorce lawyers say January’s more accurate description would be ”I’m Starting to Research My Options Month,” they agree there is some accuracy in the nomenclature. FindLaw. com’s analysis of American divorce filings between 2008 and 2011, with legal research service Westlaw, revealed a spike in divorces in January, followed by a rise and peak in late March. The site’s analysis also showed that searches for ”divorce” and related phrases like ”family law” and ”child custody” jumped 50% from December to January, and continued to swell through March.  So, what exactly happens in those first three months of the year that makes seemingly happily wed couples join the estimated 40% of first marriages that end in divorce in the United States? ”People don’t want to be accused by friends, family that they were heartless right before Christmas,” said Miles Mason, a   family and divorce lawyer. ”If somebody is coming to us in January, they made the decision to come see me or a lawyer before the holidays.” For some, it’s all about the Benjamins. The end of the year means bonus season, a portion of which can be claimed as an asset from a spouse. Holding off until January will also not interfere with tax filings for the previous year, which most couples file jointly.  Mason says many are on the fence when they begin preliminary conversations with a lawyer. They want to know the basics: what it’s going to cost, how much it will affect daily life and other practical concerns. He says people, especially heavy planners, want to have a holistic strategy in order to make smart legal and personal decisions. That’s often why a client will begin the conversation in January and wait until March to actually file. ”Divorce is counterintuitive,” he said. Mark Banschick, psychiatrist and author of ”The Intelligent Divorce” series of books, calls the start of a new year an ”existential moment” in that people look at their lives and realize that they go by too quickly and that their current version is not happy.  ”They call attorneys out of pain,” he said.  Banschick says that just wanting a change isn’t a good enough reason it’s easy to displace all the burden of your unhappiness on the spouse.  ”There’s nobody that can hurt you like the person you love,” he said. ”Because love is an opportunity to feel validated. But that vulnerability that allows somebody to acknowledge you is the same vulnerability that allows you to feel devastated.” The best time for divorce, according to him, is when you’re feeling centered about who you are and what you need. Susan Pease Gadoua is the author of ”Contemplating Divorce, A    Guide to Deciding Whether to Stay or Go” and a licensed therapist. She, like Banschick and Mason, also experiences an uptick in phone calls near the first of the year after folks   it through the holidays. ”The problem with divorce is that there’s never a good time,” she said. But all three experts referenced another unlikely month for the same phenomenon: September. Banschick says it’s because summertime is wedding and vacation season the kids are home from school, and ”it’s not a time to make troubles.”  The shared root of their conclusion:  This particular season of togetherness is over now it’s back to real life.

31774,31817,50584,Meryl Streep attacks Trump in Golden Globes acceptance speech,CNN,,1/9/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Meryl Streep was honored at the Golden Globes for a lifetime of notable work, and she took the opportunity to make a sustained attack on US   Donald Trump. In a nearly   address while accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Award, the actress denounced Trump’s campaign rhetoric and criticized him for mocking a disabled reporter. Related: Trump attacks Streep for speech at Golden Globes, As the audience of Hollywood stars and executives sat in silence, Streep said: ”There was one performance this year that stunned me. It sank its hooks in my heart. Not because it was good, there was nothing good about it, but it was effective and it did its job. ”It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter. Someone he outranked in privilege, power and the capacity to fight back.” Streep’s comments were a reference to a rally by Trump in November 2015 when he imitated New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, who has a condition that affects his joint movements. Trump has always denied he was mocking the reporter. In an interview with the The New York Times Monday morning, Trump said he was ”not surprised” by the criticism from ”liberal movie people,” pointing out that Streep was a supporter of his defeated rival, Hillary Clinton. Streep used her speech to highlight the importance to American culture of outsiders and foreigners, whom she said were among the ”most vilified segments in American society right now.   ”Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners and if we kick them all out, you’ll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts,” Streep said to huge applause from the room. RELATED: Golden Globes 2017: ’La La Land’ breaks record, Streep said Trump’s attack on the New York Times reporter legitimized bullying.  ”It kind of broke my heart when I saw it and I still can’t get it out of my head because it wasn’t in a movie, it was real life,” Streep said. ”This instinct to humiliate when it’s modeled by someone in the public . .. by someone powerful, it filters down into everyone’s life because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same.” Streep added: ”When the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose.” She called on the press to ”hold power to account, to call him on the carpet for every outrage”    another apparent reference to Trump.  Streep asked audience members to support the nonprofit Committee to Protect Journalists ”because we’re going to need them going forward and they’re going to need us to safeguard the truth.” The Golden Globes are awarded by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. Trump: Streep is a ’Hillary lover’ Responding to Streep’s speech, Trump again denied mocking Kovaleski. ”I was never mocking anyone,” Trump told the New York Times. ”People keep saying I that I intended to mock the reporter’s disability, as if Meryl Streep and others could read my mind, and I did no such thing.” Trump, who had not seen the speech, called Streep ”a Hillary lover,” according to the Times.  At the Globes and online, Streep received support from her peers.  Audience members listened with rapt attention. Actress Kerry Washington appeared near tears in the audience when the camera cut to her. On Twitter, the actress Julianne Moore wrote: ”Thank you #MerylStreep.” ”Everything she said. Thank you #MerylStreep for you work and everything you said tonight,” added Laverne Cox. The response to Streep’s speech wasn’t all positive.  Fox News host Sean Hannity tweeted: ”This is exactly why Hwood is DYING, what a bunch of hypocrites. Sex, violence, and drivel rule hwood. Turning the channel.” Radio host Meghan McCain, daughter of Republican Senator John McCain, added: ”This Meryl Streep speech is why Trump won. And if people in Hollywood don’t start recognizing why and how   you will help him get  .” Streep also drew some criticism from the Mixed Martial Arts community.  In a letter posted to Twitter, Scott Coker, an MMA promoter and fighter, invited Streep to an upcoming event in Los Angeles so she can see ”that Mixed Martial Arts is truly artistic.”  Streep closed her speech with a quote from her late friend Carrie Fisher: ”Take your broken heart, make it into art.” "
31775,31818,50585,How did Fort Lauderdale suspect get gun back?,CNN,,1/9/17,2017,1,," (CNN) He was incoherent and agitated. Voices in his head told him to join ISIS, according to law enforcement sources.  Authorities were so concerned when Esteban Santiago visited the FBI Anchorage, Alaska, office in November that they confiscated his gun and ordered a mental health evaluation. A month later, Santiago retrieved the weapon from police headquarters. Last week, Santiago, 26, used that same gun, law enforcement sources said, to kill five people and wound several others at Fort   International Airport. Santiago confessed to planning the assault, according to court papers. As authorities work to pinpoint Santiago’s motive, others are asking another question: Why did the suspected gunman still have his firearm? Federal law, The federal Gun Control Act bars a person ”who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution,” from owning a firearm.  That means a court or a lawful judicial authority must have issued an order requiring an involuntary mental health commitment, according to CNN legal analyst Paul Callan, a former New York City homicide prosecutor.  ”Unless there was some sort of a court order requiring involuntary commitment for mental health treatment, under existing gun control legislation, he could not be deprived of his constitutional right to possesses a weapon,” Callan said. Callan added, ”People who submit to voluntary mental health treatment don’t lose their right to possess firearms under current US law.” Callan said mental health authorities are required by law to warn potential targets of a possible violent attack if the patient reveals this during their treatment. It’s unknown how long Santiago spent in the medical facility for his mental evaluation and what it revealed. The CNN Guns Project, Gun control laws pertaining to the mentally ill, Some states have adopted tougher restrictions than federal laws on gun ownership for people with mental health issues.  In Maryland, a person may not possess a regulated firearm if the person suffers from a mental disorder or ”has a history of violent behavior” against other persons, according to the Washington, D. C.  National Conference of State Legislatures. ”Some other states include voluntary commitment in their barriers to gun ownership,” said CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos, a personal injury and criminal defense attorney. In the District of Columbia, police have to confirm that a registration applicant ”has not been voluntarily or involuntarily committed to any mental hospital or institution” in the five years immediately preceding the application. The applicant must present medical documents showing they have recovered from the mental issue that led to the commitment, according the law.  Alaska, however, follows the federal law on mental health and gun ownership. Santiago’s brother, Bryan, told CNN in an interview he believed the shooting rampage stemmed from mental issues that surfaced after Santiago’s   tour in Iraq while serving in the Puerto Rico National Guard. Santiago requested medical help from the military and federal agencies, his brother said. He received some treatment. In Santiago’s meeting with the FBI, he told them an intelligence agency was telling him to watch ISIS videos, law enforcement sources said. He said he didn’t intend to harm anyone, the FBI said. The FBI said it closed its assessment of Santiago after conducting database reviews, checking with other agencies and interviewing family members, according to a senior federal law enforcement official.  ”There is a big difference between recognizing something is very off about a person and them being actually adjudicated with a mental defect or involuntarily committed,” said Cevallos.  Here is a look at the evolution of gun laws in America."

31777,31821,50588,North Korea sends message to Trump amid missile threat ,CNN,James Griffiths,1/9/17,2017,1,," (CNN) North Korea says it could launch an intercontinental ballistic missile ”at any time,” even as Pyongyang appeared to offer Donald Trump an avenue for future talks. Tensions on the Korean peninsula have risen considerably since leader Kim Jong Un said in his new year’s message that the country was close to testing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of delivering a nuclear weapon to the US mainland.  In a statement Sunday, a spokesman from North Korea’s foreign minister said ”the US is wholly to blame” for the development of its missile program. Speaking to NBC’s ”Meet the Press” on Sunday, Defense Secretary Ash Carter called it a ”serious threat” and said the US would shoot down any missile aimed at it or an ally.  China and South Korea on Monday denounced the North Korea missile threat, and warned that a test could lead to further sanctions. ”If North Korea disregards our warning and launches an ICBM, it will face more powerful and thorough sanctions and pressure by the international community,” South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman Moon   said.  Few options  Strict international sanctions have so far failed to prevent Pyongyang from developing its nuclear program. In the Sunday statement, the country’s foreign ministry alluded to those sanctions and said US officials ”spout rubbish” when they assume Obama’s policies will be maintained in future.  ”Anyone who wants to deal with (North Korea) would be well advised to secure a new way of thinking after having clear understanding of it,” the statement said. John Delury, associate professor of international studies at Yonsei University said the statement was ”definitely a message to the Trump transition team to say don’t go down this dead end (of sanctions).” Trump talks? Following Pyongyang’s apparent nuke threat in Kim’s new year’s speech, Trump tweeted that ”North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the US. It won’t happen!”  Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway was later asked on ”Good Morning America” what the   intended to do to stop North Korea’s nukes. ”He’s not stated that publicly, and he won’t before he’s inaugurated,” Conway said. Analysts have said that Trump, through his own pronouncements and the failure of the Obama administration to prevent North Korea from developing its nuclear arsenal, is left with few options. Since   talks broke down in 2009, North Korea has claimed to have conducted four successful nuclear tests, strengthening its hand in any future negotiations. ”There’s no question signaling is going on,” Delury said.  ”(The North Koreans) are trying to create some space for Trump to reverse the Obama policy and talk with them in a serious way.”  Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the Rand Corporation, told CNN last week that despite North Korea’s apparent progress on a warhead, it doesn’t yet have good enough missile and rocket technology to deliver a nuke. The US has been working with South Korea to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system (THAAD) in that country, but the future of the program is in doubt under a Trump administration. "
31778,31823,50590,More women got mammograms when Obamacare paid for them ,CNN,,1/9/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Obamacare eliminated the costs and    expenses for Americans wanting preventive health care services    including mammography and colonoscopy, both tests able to detect cancer. Among older Americans, use of mammography increased under Obamacare, according to a study published Monday in the journal Cancer. But another preventive screen test, colonoscopy, didn’t see a similar increase. Offered a free mammogram, more women of all income and education levels accessed the test, according to Dr. Gregory Cooper, lead author of the study and program director of gastroenterology at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center and the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center. ”We wanted to see, as a natural experiment, what happens when you change the financial burden on preventive services,” Cooper said.    Donald Trump and the Republican Party have said they will ”repeal and replace” the health care program, which was signed into law in 2010, with most parts of the plan phased in by 2014. It remains unclear which parts will remain and which will be replaced. ”We don’t know what the future of Obamacare is,” Cooper said, though he’s heard that some pieces of the Affordable Care Act may be rescued, such as coverage of dependents up to age 26 and those with   conditions.  ”I haven’t heard anything about preventive services, but I would argue that, even if the program itself is dismantled, that would be a worthy benefit to keep,” Cooper said. Mining the data, To tally how many people used mammography and colonoscopy preventive services before and after Obamacare, Cooper and his colleagues examined Medicare claims data for beneficiaries 70 or older.  They chose this group because they had access to data and were interested in longitudinal effects of Obamacare. ”We were actually able to look at the same folks before and after,” Cooper said. ”So that was one advantage.”   They identified women who had not had a mammogram in the previous two years and both men and women who had not undergone a colonoscopy in the past five years. Then, using claims data, Cooper and his colleagues compared the women and men who got tested in the periods before and after the Affordable Care Act: 2009 to 2010 versus 2011 to 2012.  Medicare uses a guideline of mammography testing every one to two years for women age 40 years and older, according to the 2002 standard set forth by the US Preventive Services Task Force, an independent, volunteer panel of national experts in prevention and   medicine. (The task force has proposed a more recent guideline, which has not yet been adopted by Medicare.) When it comes to colonoscopy, the task force recommendation is to get tested starting at age 50 and continuing until 75.  ”We know that more affluent people are more likely to get screened,” Cooper said. ”If you take away some of the financial barriers, would the gap between the poorest and wealthiest begin to narrow?” Narrowing the gap, After    expenses were eliminated under Obamacare, the rates of women getting mammograms increased. Though women with lower incomes and education levels were tested less, the cancer screening gap narrowed between the   and   groups.  For colonoscopy, there were no real changes in testing numbers after Obamacare. In both periods, to some extent, higher socioeconomic status predicted testing. ”At least for mammography, (the study results) are largely consistent with what we know from prior research,” said David H. Howard, associate professor in health policy and management at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health, who was not involved in the research. He believes the low uptake of colonoscopy is due to   barriers, including the invasiveness of the procedure. ”In terms of bang for the buck, it’s one of the more valuable cancer screening services,” Howard said, adding that reduced   does not have much of an effect. ”Generally, a lot of people don’t get colonoscopy, even though it’s recommended.” According to both Howard and Lauren Hersch Nicholas, an assistant professor of health economics at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, the study results are similar to previous studies that looked at health care utilization: Generally, it is known that when people have to pay more for medical care, they get less of it.  However, said Nicholas, who was also not involved in the study, the ”study does not provide enough information to know whether the observed trends over time are due to the ACA changes or any number of other changes,” such as differences in the health of patients or their awareness of screening. Howard agreed. ”Always with this type of study, it’s hard to tie the changes we see directly to the change in policy.” Still, the study detected a positive trend in mammography testing overall.  ”The gap narrowed,” said Cooper. ”Maybe in the   Care   that was a barrier: the out of pocket expense.”"
31779,31825,50592,How to design a car for the future,CNN,,1/9/17,2017,1,," (CNN) No car manufacturer has a longer history of making internal   cars than  .   Which means that, for well over a century, Mercedes has been designing cars to meet the needs of, not just people, but engines too.   design has given us upholstered seats, car stereos and Apple CarPlay. Engines, on the other hand, have inspired long hoods,   grills and chrome side pipes. But what if it were possible to forget the engine and just design cars for people?    electric vehicles, with their small motors and flexibly shaped battery packs, make that very nearly possible.  A new design freedom, For Mercedes designers working on the new   line of electric vehicles, removing the internal combustion engine is an exciting opportunity but also a challenge    how to capitalize on the design freedom promised by electric vehicles without losing touch with the Mercedes’ long history.  For instance, electric motors don’t need nearly as much air as combustion engines so you could lose the grill, right? Not so fast. It’s still a Mercedes. ”We can’t get rid of the face,” said Robert Lesnik, director of exterior design for Mercedes. ”This is something from the past that is definitely an icon. A Mercedes should look like a Mercedes.” But in the Generation EQ concept    the preview of the first EQ model unveiled at the 2016 Paris Motor Show    the grill is really a screen, like the front of an iPhone. Horizontal slats and the   star are drawn in bright blue pixels. The concept made another appearance at the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, earlier this month.  In the   the headlights are not separate elements, distinct from the grill. They’re part of the continuous surface, adding to an impression of almost impossible smoothness. Mercedes’ design philosophy has long focused on cleanliness and simplicity, Lesnik explains. There should be a minimum of extraneous decoration, he says. Electric drive technology makes simple design even, well, simpler. ”If you look at our new Generation EQ you really see how clean the car is. There are no lines, no creases, no undercuts.” The proportion of the EQ, more than anything, makes clear its relationship to the rest of Mercedes’ SUVs. It stands out but it’s still part of the family. ”First of all, for me, as a designer, the proportion is the essential thing of Mercedes,” he says. It’s true for all types of vehicles, of course. Most car brands have a formula for how the roofline, hood,   and trunk should all play off one another to form a unique shape that communicates, even on a foggy day, who made that car.  Electric cars won’t change that, Lesnik insists. ”We really concentrate on the pure shape, on sensuality in the shape. Sculpture will become much more important.” Even in an electric world, the past will shape the future.  ”Sure, you can do whatever you want but in the end it has to be Mercedes.” "
31780,31826,50593,"Jerusalem truck attack suspect may have supported ISIS, Netanyahu says",CNN,Amy La Porte,1/8/17,2017,1,,"Jerusalem (CNN) The driver who plowed a truck into a group of soldiers in Jerusalem, killing four people and injuring at least 10, may have been an ISIS sympathizer, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  Two soldiers and a tour guide who is a colonel in the reserves shot and killed the attack suspect, whom they identified as    Fadi Qunbar. Police have also arrested nine other suspects, including five of Qunbar’s family members. Speaking from the scene of the attack, on a promenade overlooking the walled Old City of Jerusalem, Netanyahu said authorities have identified the terrorist and ”all signs show he is a supporter of the Islamic State.”  ”We know there is a sequence of terror attacks and it’s quite possible that there is a connection between them, from France, Berlin and now Jerusalem,” Netanyahu said.  Israel will now consider using administrative detention against suspected ISIS sympathizers and supporters, according to an official familiar with the decision. Earlier, Israel Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told CNN ”there are no potential active ISIS cells here in Israel.”   Netanyahu said police had sealed off Qunbar’s predominately Arab neighborhood in East Jerusalem while they investigate. Hamas praises driver, While no group has claimed responsibility for the attack, Hamas, the militant fundamentalist Islamic organization, praised the attacker on Twitter.  ”We bless the courageous and heroic truck operation in Jerusalem,” the group tweeted. ”It comes within the context of the normal response to the crimes of the Israeli occupation.” Hamas’ goal is the creation of an Islamic fundamentalist Palestinian state and they insist that Israel is an occupying power and must be destroyed. Victims identified, Three of the four people killed were women. Israel Defense Forces said three of the slain were cadets and one was an officer. All of the slain victims were in their 20s.  ”A group had gotten off the bus and were getting organized with their bags when the terrorist took the opportunity, ramming his truck into the group,” Rosenfeld said.  ”Then he in fact reversed and tried to ram them again until shots were fired, and the terrorist was shot and killed at the scene.”  The four soldiers killed in the Jerusalem truck attack Sunday have been identified by Israel Defense Forces. They are:     2nd Lt. Yael Yekutiel, 20, of Givatayim,    Cadet Shir Hajaj, 22, of Maale Adumim,    Cadet Shira Tsur, 20, of Haifa,    Cadet Erez Orbach, 20, of  Alon Shvut, Netanyahu posted photos of the four soldiers on Facebook with this message: ”I am mourning the loss of our four soldiers who were murdered today in the terrorist attack in Jerusalem. In the name of all the people of Israel, I offer my condolences to their families.” Several other officers and cadets were injured and evacuated to hospitals for medical treatment, IDF said. In a statement, Jerusalem’s mayor, Nir Barkat, said there was ”no limit to the cruelty of the terrorists who use every means to murder Jews and damage the routine life in the capital of Israel.”  On Monday, police in Israel prevented the assembly of a mourning area for the attacker on a rooftop in Jabel Mukaber, according to a police statement. US response, In a statement, the US State Department condemned the ”glorification of terrorism now or at any time” and said ”there is absolutely no justification for these brutal and senseless attacks.”  Truck attacks: A frightening tool of terror, with a history, Diplomatic tensions have flared between the United States and Israel in recent weeks after the Obama administration decided not to veto a UN Security Council resolution condemning Israel and its construction of new settlements in East Jerusalem.

31781,31827,50594,Returning home to find your house in a ’different country’,CNN,Erin McLaughlin,1/9/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Hatchet in hand,    Dato Vanishvili paces back and forth in the patchy snow he says he’s a prisoner in his own front yard.  Trapped behind a barbed wire fence, the   elderly farmer hacks at the bare branches of his fruit trees, scavenging much needed fuel to ward off the biting cold of the Georgian winter. ”They don’t let me go,” he says, plaintively. ”I’m stuck here. Where should I go? I don’t have food, bread, I don’t have anything. What should I do? Kill myself?”   To Georgians, Vanishvili is the desperate face of a frozen conflict, a victim of what some call the ”creeping border”    and Georgia calls the ”line of occupation.” His home straddles the disputed line that divides Georgia and South Ossetia.  READ MORE: Why Russia’s military adventures worry Europe, House in ’different country’ Five years ago, Vanishvili says he left the house to run some errands in the local village, only to find his house fenced off, effectively in a different country, when he returned.   ”They said: ’This is Russian territory, so if you don’t want to be in Russia leave from here,’” he says. ”I’m from South Ossetia, in Georgia. I’m Vanishvili, a Georgian citizen!” He says he faced an impossible choice: Abandon his home, or lose contact with the country he loves.  Now razor wire slices through his garden, penning Vanishvili, his grandson and ailing wife into their home. A knowledgeable source indicated to CNN on a map where boundary movements had occurred. ”I’m stuck here,” Vanishvili says. ”If I cross they will arrest me and I will have to pay money, like penalty. They are watching me.” The only time he sees his neighbors is when they come to mourn lost relatives buried in the cemetery on the other side of his property: Barred from entering it, they ask him to lay flowers on the graves on their behalf, sometimes bringing care packages by way of thanks. The Vanishvilis are cut off not only from friends and family, but also, they say, from essentials such as gas and electricity, leaving them reliant on firewood for heating.  ”My life became worse and worse. Help me if you can,” he pleads from the other side of the fence. But there is little anyone in Georgia can do.  READ MORE: Russia’s military might in numbers, Life in  ’  Vanishvili is just one victim of what European Union monitors call Russian ”borderization”    they say Russia is steadily creating a new border inside the former Soviet state.  Merab Mekarishvili’s home near the small farming village of Dvani was bombed during the 2008 conflict between Georgia and Russia, but he was determined to keep living there. Then the Russians came and fenced off the road, leaving the house his father had built on one side of the wire, the family’s land on the other. He says they gave him a choice: Become a citizen of South Ossetia, or move.  He gave up his home and lives nearby on what remains of the property, where he is building a new house    within sight of the   old one    using any materials he can gather.  Tamara Qoreli lives in no man’s land with her husband and two grandchildren, their cozy home sandwiched between a Georgian border post and a Russian checkpoint and overlooked by a Russian border guard base.  She says life here has been more difficult since the war. ”Earlier it was good,” she says. ”I was making my life by having cows, but after the war I have only one cow, which I am taking here and there by rope . .. because there are minefields.”  ”I used to have income and now I am left without,” she says. ”We have no pension, no social aid, we have absolutely nothing.” READ MORE: ICC opens inquiry into   war, Frontier creeping forward, An EU monitoring mission patrols what is officially known as the Administrative Boundary Line between Georgia and the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  In recent years, monitors say, the line has crept forward, swallowing farmland. ”Many people don’t know in many places where the line is,” Kestutis Jankauskas, head of the EU monitoring mission, tells CNN. ”It [the border] is being established by practice but it is nothing official. It is [a] very fluid notion of a line.” Sometimes the Russian troops use razor wire fencing to mark what they see as the border at others they post green signs saying ”passage forbidden” in Georgian and English.  These signs often stand alone, creating confusion for locals, who complain they’ve been detained and fined for unwittingly crossing the line. This year, the Russians dug two trenches through prime orchard land, claiming the move was for fire protection purposes, but Georgians who traversed the ditches say they were detained. ”We don’t know where and how far that line can move because it was never recognized it was never negotiated,” explains Jankauskas, adding that it is most likely based on old Soviet General Staff maps from the 1980s.

John Durnin, spokesman for the EU monitoring mission, says the Russian border guard bases, which began appearing in South Ossetia in 2009, are part of Russia’s Federal Security Service, the FSB.  Built so that they can be quickly reinforced when necessary, each is home to between 30 and 50 soldiers. They also include quarters for married couples and families and even playgrounds for children.  Local residents say they believe the bases are a sign that the Russians are here to stay. CNN’s trip to the area highlighted the tension and suspicion on both sides of the line our visits were only allowed in the company of Georgian security forces or EU monitors, and on several occasions we were watched closely by men in green on the other side.  An EU monitoring mission hotline, usually reserved for messages about movements along the boundary, was activated by Russian border guards demanding to know why we were there.

Russia ups role in world events, Referendum on accession, It is 25 years since Georgia gained its independence from the Soviet Union the breakaway state has had a contentious relationship with its Russian neighbor ever since.  In 2008, it spiraled into   conflict, after South Ossetian separatists attacked Georgian peacekeepers. Georgia sent troops into South Ossetia, and Russia responded with a military incursion into Georgia itself. When the fighting ended, Russia’s military pulled back only as far as South Ossetia, which they see as an independent state. And in 2017, things could get yet more complicated: In a move that invites comparisons to the annexation of Crimea, South Ossetia is to hold a referendum on accession to Russia.  The Kremlin remains silent on the vote, neither ruling it out nor welcoming it. Russia’s state news agency TASS reports Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying: ”I will not comment on this issue, this is not our matter.”  But tacit support from Russia is clear: in April 2016, the Russian Duma ratified a treaty on the demarcation of the state border of South Ossetia.

31782,31829,50596,Brazilian prison riot leaves 4 dead,CNN,,1/8/17,2017,1,," (CNN) Four people died Sunday in a riot at a prison in Brazil, the nation’s third deadly prison uprising in seven days. Three inmates were decapitated and one was asphyxiated in the Desembargador Raimundo Vidal Pessoa public jail in the northern part of the country, reported the Amazonas State Penitentiary Administration Secretariat. Video showed heavily armed police officers entering the prison in the center of Manaus, a city with 1. 7 million residents. The jail, which was shut down in October because of improper conditions, was reopened last week after deadly uprisings at other prisons in Brazil. Nearly 300 prisoners had been transferred to the jail, with state authorities saying they would remain for three months. On January 1, at least 56 prisoners died in a riot at the Anisio Jobim Penitentiary Complex, also in Manaus.  A Friday riot at the Agricultural Penitentiary of Monte Cristo, in Brazil’s Roraima state in the Amazon, left at least 33 people dead, authorities said.    people died in October in a riot at that same prison. The federal government said last week it will make resources available to the states to improve the local prisons under a new federal security plan.  Federal and state officials think the uprisings in Amazonas state were caused by a territorial dispute between rival gangs First Capital Command, known as PCC, and Families of the North, known as FDN. The uprisings in Roraima state are still being investigated.  According to state news agency Agencia Brasil, Roraima state has requested assistance from the National Guard to police its prisons.  The initial request came after an October riot at the Agricultural Penitentiary of Monte Cristo. Brazil has the fourth largest prison population in the world, with more than 622, 000 people behind bars, according to its justice ministry. That puts it behind the United States, Russia and China. "
