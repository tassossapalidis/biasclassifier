7803,7803,26539,CNN’s Zeleny: ’Hard to Imagine’ Obama Would Have Commuted Manning If Manning Wasn’t Transitioning - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ian Hanchett,1/17/17,2017,1,,"On Tuesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “Situation Room,” CNN Senior Washington Correspondent Jeff Zeleny stated that Chelsea Manning’s transition from a man to a woman “certainly played into” President Obama’s decision to commute Manning’s sentence, and “Without that, it’s hard to imagine, I think, this president would have done that. ”  Zeleny said, “I think a question that this president the White House will have to answer here  —   will answer, and I think it’s an important one, if  —   how much was the personal story of Chelsea Manning involved in this, because the outcry from the left was so strong on this. And she’s having a difficult time in federal prison, no question. But, to me, that is a central question here. Without that, you have to wonder if the outcome would be the same. I think it might not be. ” He added, “[B]ecause she transitioned from a man to a woman, I think all of that certainly played into this. Without that, it’s hard to imagine, I think, this president would have done that. ” (  Mediaite) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"

[The Daily Mail reports that the group was aboard the Captain Hook Pirate Ship dinner cruise with other revelers when they broke out into the chants, shocking other tourists on board.  Anaximandro Amable Burga, a Peruvian tourist, was on board with his Mexican wife Suly when he witnessed the scene. “Today I was with Suly, my wife (who is a native of Mexico) watching an entertainment show off the coast of Cancun aboard a boat, and at the end of the show, a flock of Americans (maybe under the influence of alcohol, or maybe not) began to sing the infamous ‘Build that wall’ chant louder and louder,’” he wrote on Facebook. Mexican tourists aboard the ship reportedly complained about the chants, but the spring breakers did not stop. The Yucatan Times denounced the chanting in an editorial Friday saying it was an act of “xenophobia and discrimination against Mexicans within their own country. ” The paper also added that the “racist hymn” was “far from being an isolated incident” that has drawn the ire of tourism sector workers who say that the spring breakers’ actions were offensive and rude towards the Mexican people. This is not the only time chants of “build a wall” have been deemed racist by others. CNN called a video of children chanting “build a wall” at a Michigan middle school that went viral in December an example of “racism. ” Photo: file"
7805,7805,26541,Surge in ’Honour Crimes’ and Forced Marriages in London,Breitbart,Liam Deacon,4/8/17,2017,4,,"honour crimes have risen by 40 per cent in five years in London, with the number of forced marriages doubling in the same period. [According to the figures, obtained by the Evening Standard, some of the children involved in the abuse were younger than   .  Since 2012, honour crimes reported to the Metropolitan Police rose to 1, 081 and those relating to forced marriages shot up to 367. Women and girls were the victims in the vast majority of reported incidents, with over half coming from “Asian” backgrounds, the paper reports. Knives and guns were involved in more than 70 incidents, and dozens of rapes and other sexual crimes were reported. Detective Chief Inspector Sam Faulkner, of the Met’s Community Safety Unit, said the crimes stem from communities using “cultural   religious justifications for male violence against women and girls and other people”. They were often based on traditions whereby “an individual, family and community’s honour is weighted on women and girls” he said, including refusing to go along with a marriage. “We see an increase in these types of offences as a positive step, an indication that victims have more confidence to report offences to police and seek the support they need” he added. Politicians today called the findings “troubling” “shocking” and “abhorrent”. Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, told the Evening Standard: “Too many of these awful crimes are still hidden. There is no ‘honour’ in violence against women, rape, torture or abuse of a family member. “These are deadly crimes and there is still too little protection, too few prosecutions and too much stigma which prevents people coming forward. “It’s vital that when victims do speak out they get proper help from support groups and from the police to keep them safe. ” The figures, obtained using Freedom of Information requests, show that “violence against the person” was the most common “honour” attack, accounting for 85 per cent of incidents. Sexual violence was the second largest category, with 56 rapes and 11 “other sexual” crimes. 84 per cent were perpetrated against women, with “Asian” women accounting for more than half."

7807,7807,26543,Jared Kushner at Center of Media Spotlight on Russian Ties to Trump Campaign - Breitbart,Breitbart,Penny Starr,5/27/17,2017,5,,"The focus of the continuous media reports of alleged collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign has shifted to Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s    husband of his daughter Ivanka, and top adviser. [Kushner is said to have discussed with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak the possibility of establishing a direct and secure conduit for communication between Moscow and Trump’s transition team, established after Trump won the 2016 presidential election, the Washington Post reported on Friday.  “  Trump made the proposal during a meeting on Dec. 1 or 2 at Trump Tower, according to intercepts of Russian communications that were reviewed by U. S. officials,” the Post reported. “Kislyak said Kushner suggested using Russian diplomatic facilities in the United States for the communications. ” Michael Flynn, Trump’s first national security adviser, also attended the meeting, according to the Post, which cites no sources for its report except “U. S. officials” and “people familiar with the matter. ” The White House acknowledged the meeting in March, but “played down it’s significance,” the Post reported, adding that the FBI now considers the meeting  —   and another with a Russian banker  —   worthy of investigation. “Neither the meeting nor the communications of Americans involved were under U. S. surveillance,” the Post reports that officials said. No one responded to requests for comments from the Post, including the White House, Robert Kelner, a lawyer for Flynn, and the Russian Embassy. According to the newspaper: Russia at times feeds false information into communication streams it suspects are monitored as a way of sowing misinformation and confusion among U. S. analysts. But officials said that it’s unclear what Kislyak would have had to gain by falsely characterizing his contacts with Kushner to Moscow, particularly at a time when the Kremlin still saw the prospect of dramatically improved relations with Trump. The Post’s reporting adds drama to the Kushner angle of the ongoing Russian saga: Current and former U. S. intelligence officials said that although Russian diplomats have secure means of communicating with Moscow, Kushner’s apparent request for access to such channels was extraordinary. “How would he trust that the Russians wouldn’t leak it on their side?” one former senior intelligence official said, adding that a Trump transition member going in and out of the Russian embassy would cause “a great deal of concern. ” The entire idea, he said, “seems extremely naive or absolutely crazy. ” “It is common for senior advisers of a newly elected president to be in contact with foreign leaders and officials,” the story stated towards the end, citing U. S. intelligence’s belief in an “unprecedented campaign” by the Russians “to interfere in last year’s presidential race and help elect Trump. ” And, the “Obama administration officials say members of the Trump transition team never approached them about arranging a secure communications channel with their Russian contacts, possibly because of concerns about leaks,” the Post reported. And, “the State Department, the White House National Security Council and U. S. intelligence agencies all have the ability to set up secure communications channels with foreign leaders, though doing so for a transition team would be unusual. ” In addition, the Post reports they first heard about the Kushner meeting though an “anonymous letter, which said, among other things, that Kushner had talked to Kislyak about setting up the communications channel. ” “In addition to their discussion about setting up the communications channel, Kushner, Flynn and Kislyak also talked about arranging a meeting between a representative of Trump and a ‘Russian contact’ in a third country whose name was not identified, according to the anonymous letter,” the Post reported."

7810,7810,26546,20-Year-Old Brit Dies Fighting Islamic State in Syria,Breitbart,Nick Hallett,1/3/17,2017,1,,"A    British man who traveled to Syria to fight against Islamic State has been killed in battle, his family have said. [Ryan Lock, a former chef who had no previous military training, told his family he was vacationing in Turkey before crossing the Syrian border and joining the Kurdish People’s Defence Units (YPG). He died on 21 December during an assault on Raqqa, Islamic State’s de facto capital.  The YPG wrote a letter to Mr Lock’s family informing them of his death and praising him for his bravery. The Guardian reports that it said: Ryan joined actively in our offensive against the terror threat that Isis caused upon Rojava, Kurdistan. Here, in the dark hours of December 21, 2016, we lost our brave companion Ryan and four other fighters in Jaeber village. Ryan was not only a fighter providing additional force to our struggle. In fact, with his experience and knowledge he has been an example for younger fighters. While he has reached a vast amount of achievement up in our front lines, Ryan has served the purpose of a very important bridge between us, the Kurds of Rojava. He crossed continents for the destiny of our people and humanity. Mr Lock is the third Brit to die fighting Islamic State. Dean Evans, a    farmer, died in July 2016 in northern Syria, and Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, a former Royal Marine, was killed in March 2015. Ryan Lock was just weeks away from returning home when he was killed. He wrote on Facebook on 31 August: “I’m on my way to Rojava. I lied about going to Turkey. I’m sorry I didn’t tell anyone. I love all of you and I will be back in six months. ” He narrowly escaped death on 24 November when most of his unit was killed in an airstrike, allegedly by the Turkish air force. Twelve fighters were killed, including American Michael Israel and German Anton Leschek. In a statement, his father said: “Ryan was a very caring and loving boy who would do anything to help anyone. “He had a heart of gold. We ask for privacy to allow our family to grieve. ”"
7811,7811,26547,"Meet Judith Clark, the Domestic Terrorist Granted Clemency by Gov. Andrew Cuomo - Breitbart",Breitbart,Daniel J. Flynn,1/17/17,2017,1,,"“Were you on drugs?” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo asked convicted murderer Judith Clark before commuting part of her     sentence. “No,” she explained. “I was on politics. ”[Clark’s addiction long predated her participation in the October 20, 1981 robbery of an armored car that left a guard and two cops dead.  “There’s no question I was a red diaper baby,” she wrote in an autobiographical sketch. “I was still in diapers when my mother, Ruth, journeyed across two oceans with my    brother and me to the Soviet Union to join my father in a   sojourn. My father, Joe, was a CP organizer from the age fourteen. In 1949, when I was born, he was a Party leader and writer for the Daily Worker. My mother, like many Party women, was a mass organizer, working with settlement houses on the Lower East Side and on the congressional election campaigns of progressive politicians such as Vito Marcantonio. ” Like Brink’s robbery   Kathy Boudin, Greenwich Village townhouse casualty Ted Gold, and Weatherman comrade Eleanor Raskin, Judy Clark grew up Old Left only to find political expression in the New Left. “Some of them were trying to repudiate their past,” former Weatherman Mark Rudd tells Breitbart News of the   babies. “Some of them were trying to better their parents. ” As Clark herself explained during a 2003 appeal, “My choice of social activism and even the vehemence of my beliefs were, in some ways, consistent with my parents’ values and history. But my insistence on the need for violence represented a real break from their values. This was part of its attraction for me. While I was driven to take up their abandoned mission of transforming society, I also felt I had to atone for their failure to sustain their commitment. ” Whereas her parents displayed contempt for America by migrating to Stalin’s Russia, Judy Clark did so by taking the fight to the streets of America. Chicago cops arrested Clark at the Days of Rage, the 1969 orgy of violence that resulted in one of Mayor Richard J. Daley’s confidantes becoming a quadriparetic. Late that year at the Wargasm in Flint, where the Weathermen iconized Charles Manson, Clark created, along with future Brinks   Kathy Boudin and       Diana Oughton, a massive poster spelling out murdered actress Sharon Tate’s name in bullets. When the FBI caught up to Clark outside of a Manhattan movie house in late 1970, the federal fugitive ate pieces of paper while fleeing before kicking, swearing, and spitting on the arresting agents. A decade later, she greeted law enforcement similarly. Becoming the only   Weatherman fugitive apprehended by authorities during the group’s heyday proved disastrous for Clark —  and law enforcement. “The people aboveground tended to be pretty hardcore,” Rudd, who evaded arrest until turning himself in to the authorities in 1977, notes. Whereas members of the Weather Underground focused on staying underground, Clark and others aboveground fixated on revolution. “People found each other,” Rudd tells Breitbart News. “Somehow or another Judy must have found people aboveground, many of whom I’ve never met, who thought like she did. ” Clark ventured forth, with several   Weathermen including Boudin and Dave Gilbert, in something called the May 19 Communist Movement. The group embarked on a series of bombings, helped break   Assata Shakur free from a New Jersey prison, and pursued “expropriations” that resulted in numerous casualties, including, ultimately, its own members, who wasted away in prison. Clark’s group of white revolutionaries joined forces with the Puerto Rican FALN and the   Black Liberation Army. On October 20, 1981, an amalgam of the BLA and May 19 calling itself The Family, robbed a Brink’s truck outside of a mall in Nanuet, New York. Earlier that year, the group robbed a Brink’s truck in the Bronx of more than a quarter of a million dollars. Tyrone Rison, who swore to Clark’s participation in the Bronx job, confessed to killing a guard in that operation. Despite understanding the risks to innocent life, Clark participated in the robbery in Nanuet that resulted in the murder of a Brink’s guard and two Nyack, New York, cops. “Shamefully,” Clark later noted of the action, “I contemplated the irony that in the name of Black Liberation, a respected black police officer, Waverly Brown, had been murdered. ” “She was armed,” Kenneth Maxwell, the FBI’s case agent on the Nanuet Brink’s robbery, points out. “The way the Family operated, every single one of them was armed going out to the scene. She was much more than a getaway driver and a lookout. She was not, as certain media and government voices purport her to be, a peripheral player. She was a leader of the May 19 Communist movement that benefitted from these robberies. ” In addition to driving the muscle to the robbery, Clark carried a gun. Maxwell notes that upon arrest, cops discovered shattered glass on her person that came from the UHaul hiding the gunmen and from a police cruiser. Rather than a momentary lapse of reason, Clark’s behavior that day fit a pattern. On June 2 of that year, a gunman alleges she played a similar role in an assault on a Brink’s truck in the Bronx that left one guard dead and another wounded, netting $250, 000 for the group’s revolutionary delusions and cocaine addictions. Two years earlier, the May 19 Communist Movement helped break Assata Shakur from prison. The indictments in that case named Clark as an uncharged  . Because it looked certain that the remainder of Clark’s days would transpire behind bars, the authorities did not bother to charge her in the deadly Bronx robbery or the prison break. Her behavior in custody in 1981 mirrored her behavior after the 1970 arrest, when she spat, kicked and swore at FBI agents. “I had heard that story,” former special agent Maxwell tells Breitbart News of the resistance that earned a place in FBI lore. “It predated my entry into the FBI. It certainly was validated by her demeanor that she exhibited   after she was captured fleeing the scene in Nyack in 1981. When they took her into custody —  extremely uncooperative. ” No mellowing took place in Clark in the 11 or so years that transpired. “When the court ordered a lineup, here’s what she did,” Maxwell explains. “She repeatedly resisted any attempts to go into the lineup to the point where she kicked, scratched, bit, and spit in the faces of   folks, hissing and screaming in a demonic way. Jim Stewart, lieutenant detective in the Rockland County district attorney’s office, said she reminded him of the character in the movie The Exorcist. That’s how Judy Clark acted. ” Her unruly conduct resulted in law enforcement placing her in a straitjacket. Her strange behavior continued in the courtroom. “I am an   freedom fighter,” Clark announced at her 1983 murder trial. “I don’t recognize the legitimacy of this Court. ” The court reciprocated by not recognizing the legitimacy of the     counsel’s arguments. At her 1983 trial, Clark demanded    status, the right to wear armbands in solidarity with the New African Freedom Fighters, and a change of venue to another nation. She compared herself to George Washington and asked potential jurors, “Do your children play cowboys and Indians?” and “Are you a member of the Ku Klux Klan?” She refused to remain in the court upon the reading of her sentence. “The D. A. calls what happened on October 20, 1981, a robbery and murder,” Clark explained to a befuddled courtroom. “We say it was an attempted expropriation because revolutionary forces must take from the powers that be to build their capabilities to struggle against this system. ” Something got lost in translation from sixties rhetoric to eighties reality. The Hiroo Onoda of the   ’t received a sentence of    . She received an additional sentence of two years in solitary confinement in 1985 after evidence implicated her in an escape plot. Until Governor Cuomo cut that mandatory minimum by more than half in late December, she looked forward to a parole date past her 100th birthday. Now she could gain release this year. Like so many of her comrades from the 1960s, Judith Clark traveled on a long, strange trip. That journey, from Stalin’s Russia to the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women, ended perhaps more predictably than the trips of others."

[“They are getting away with murder,” Trump said about drug companies at a press conference Wednesday. “Pharma has a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power and there is very little bidding on drugs. We’re the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we don’t bid properly and we’re going to start bidding and we’re going to save billions of dollars over a period of time. ”  “The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index fell 2. 6 percent at 11:28 a. m. in New York, and the Standard  Poor’s 500 Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology  Life Sciences Index was down 1. 7 percent,” Bloomberg reports. Trump also noted many drug manufacturers have relocated their legal addresses overseas to save on taxes, a situation he says he plans to address. “We have to get our drug industry coming back,” Trump said. “Our drug industry has been disastrous. They’re leaving left and right. They supply our drugs but they don’t make them here, to a large extent. ” Trump added he has plans for similar actions in other industries."
7813,7813,26549,"New Orleans Removes Famous ‘Lee Circle’ Monument, Mayor Derides Critics",Breitbart,John Binder,5/20/17,2017,5,,"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana  —   The monument to General Robert E. Lee was removed from its pedestal in Lee Circle at the heart of the city of New Orleans. Mayor Mitch Landrieu used the event to claim victory for political correctness. [The famous Civil   monument of Robert E. Lee has been at the center of the city’s most famous traffic circle for more than a century. The statue was put on the chopping block my Landrieu after he began a crusade against four monuments he deemed “symbols of white supremacy. ”  Other monuments removed by the Landrieu Administration include the Battle at Liberty Place, Jefferson Davis, and the P. G. T. Beauregard Monuments, Breitbart Texas reported. All the monuments were removed at some expense to taxpayers, as New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) and New Orleans Fire Department (NOFD) officials were present at each of the removal processes. The money to physically remove the monuments, though, came from a private donor which Landrieu has refused to disclose to the public. In an address to the city, Landrieu derided critics of his now infamous monument removal crusade, saying Davis, Beauregard and Lee were not patriots. “These monuments that we took down were meant to rebrand the history of our city and the ideals of the Confederacy” Landrieu said. “It is   that these men did not fight for the United States of America. They fought against it. They may have been warriors, but in this cause, they were not patriots. ” “These monuments celebrate a fictional, sanitized Confederacy,” Landrieu said. “Ignoring the death, ignoring the enslavement, ignoring the terror that it actually stood for. ” Landrieu hinted at what the monuments, specifically the Beauregard and Lee Circle statues, would be replaced with. “It immediately begs the question: Why are there no   monuments,” Landrieu said. “No public markers on public land to remember the lynchings or the slave blocs? Nothing to remember this long chapter of our lives of pain, of sacrifice, of shame, all of it happening on the soil of New Orleans. ” Landrieu has been widely criticized for his calling for the removal of the historical monuments, with historians asking him to add context to the monuments, rather than removing them altogether. The grassroots activist group Save Our Circle formed solely in opposition to Landrieu’s actions in regards to the monuments. They say that the monuments represent the city’s history. Take ‘Em Down Nola and STAND With Dignity, two     organizations lobbied Landrieu to go further than just the four monuments. Now, they are calling for the removal of more than a dozen monuments and street names, including: Most recently, Landrieu made a broad accusation about the impact of the four Civil   monuments on the city of New Orleans. While speaking to local media, Landrieu said the monuments caused a “great migration out of the city,” as Breitbart Texas reported. “But I will say this for people that are interested in the cost,” Landrieu said. “The cultural and economic and the spiritual loss to this city for having those statues up that have run people out of the city,” Landrieu claimed. “The great migration that sent some of our best and brightest to places across the country that we don’t have the benefit of has been incredible. ” Historians have refuted this claim in 2015, when Landrieu first demanded the monuments come down. They argued that the city serves tourists and locals as a public history museum, unlike any other city in the U. S."

[“[Trump] nominated a guy to run the EPA [Scott Pruitt] who has eight lawsuits against the EPA, and refuses to recuse himself from those lawsuits! It’s basically the   world right now, and the kind of dialogue coming out of these guys sounds like George Orwell,” Cameron told The Daily Beast.  “Alternate facts? There’s no such thing as an alternate fact! These people are insane,” Cameron said. Cameron said President Trump is going to undo all the work that was done to help avoid a   disaster that could put the planet in peril. “Years ago, we sort of spotted the iceberg ahead of us and we called out the order to turn, and we’ve been slowly, slowly, slowly trying to turn this   ship to not hit the iceberg, and then Trump grabbed the tiller and just plunged it right back at the center of the iceberg,” Cameron said. He added: So am I worried? Of course. I’m like anyone of good conscience and reasonable intelligence.

7816,7816,26552,"House Freedom Caucus Saved GOP Majority from Ryancare Disaster, Says Voter Study - Breitbart",Breitbart,Neil Munro,3/30/17,2017,3,,"A sophisticated analysis of polling data shows that the House Freedom Caucus saved the GOP’s House majority from a huge electoral backlash by helping to defeat the House Speaker Paul Ryan’s alternative to Obamacare, says Chris Wilson, head of WPA Research. [The “House Freedom Caucus members held the line, and the data show that is precisely what their constituents wanted,” he wrote in a report, titled “Analytics shows HFC saved GOP on Health Care. ”  On Thursday, Texas GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert predicted any approval of Ryan’s healthcare overhaul would wreck the GOP’s House majority in 2018. “This bill is going to ultimately result in Republicans losing the majority   …     [and] If we pass a bill that doesn’t bring down premiums and give the American people hope, and not give more power to the government   …     then we will deserve to be voted out,” he said in a speech on the House floor, according to TheHill.   “While full repeal and replace of Obamacare has overwhelming support in these districts, even keeping Obamacare intact was more popular than the AHCA, often by more than a    margin,” said Wilson, who managed Sen. Ted Cruz’s voter analysis and tracking efforts in 2016.   The same analysis was applied to 2018 Senate races and concluded that “the House Freedom Caucus did   …     Republicans’ hopes of expanding their Senate majority, a great service in stopping the [Ryancare] bill before it made it across the Capitol,” Wilson wrote.  But Wilson’s analysis also shows strong public support for an alternative    “plan that allows for the sale of insurance across state lines, expands Health Savings Accounts, incentivizes states to create   pools, block grants Medicaid, and is portable so it can be taken from job to job. ” Wilson’s analysis is based a huge national survey, which allows his group to understand the preference of each population subgroup. For example, voters are asked three questions about each issue, he said. Typically, one question is skewed from a   perspective, one question is skewed from the right, and the third question is intended to be unbiased, he said. In turn, the team then used three   models to predict preferences among each politicians’ particular subgroups of voters. In this survey, the models were used to gauge each district’s’ voters preference for three healthcare options  —   continuing Obamacare, establishing Ryan’s “Ryancare” replacement, and the third option, “Repeal and replace. ” Subsequently, the analysts spend much time check and rechecking the accuracy of the   models in each district, he said, adding “you’ve got to spend time ” Politicians are increasingly using this style of voter analysis to understand their constituents, amid constant pressure from lobbyists and donors, he said.  In the healthcare analysis, Wilson said he didn’t try to gauge why the voters approved or rejected each of the three policy options. “I don’t have the ability to discern or divine the reason why the voters answered as they did  …     that’s the next stage” of development, he added.

[From the Times:  For years, a network of immigration   in Washington was known chiefly for fending off proposals to legalize the status of more people. But with the election of a   president, these groups have moved unexpectedly to offense from defense, with some of their leaders now in positions to carry out their agenda on a national scale.   …     Mr. Trump’s senior White House adviser, Stephen Miller, worked tirelessly to defeat immigration reform as a staff member for Senator Jeff Sessions, now the attorney general. Gene P. Hamilton, who worked on illegal immigration as Mr. Sessions’s counsel on the Judiciary Committee, is now a senior counselor at the Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency of the Border Patrol and ICE, where Mr. Feere is working. Julia Hahn, who wrote about immigration for Breitbart  —   with headlines like “  Congress Oversees   Importation of Somali Migrants”  —   has followed her former boss, Stephen K. Bannon, to the White House as a deputy policy strategist.   …     Their influence is already being felt. Mr. Trump is known for his    pledges to deport millions of people here illegally and to build a border wall, but some of the administration’s more technical yet critical changes to immigration procedures came directly from officials with long ties to the   groups.   …     Even those who have labored for decades to scale back immigration did not expect such a dramatic change. “This is inconceivable a year ago,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies. “Frankly, it’s almost inconceivable six months ago. ” Click here for the rest of the article."

[“America will thrive as long as we continue to have faith in each other and faith in God,” Trump said. “That faith in God has inspired men and women to sacrifice for the needy, to deploy to wars overseas, and lock arms at home to ensure equal rights for every man, woman, and child in our land. ”  He vowed to protect religious liberty in America, specifically promising to get rid of the Johnson Amendment, which prevents churches and   organizations from endorsing and opposing political candidates. “Our republic was formed on the basis that freedom is not a gift from government, but that freedom is a gift from God,” Trump said. But Trump warned that Islamic State terrorists were specifically targeting Christians and “peaceful Muslims. ” He also mentioned that the Jewish people were under attack from terrorists. “The world is in trouble, but we’re going to straighten it out. That’s what I do,” Trump said. “I fix things. We’re going the straighten it out. Believe me. ” The president paid tribute to slain Navy SEAL Mark Owens and quoted John 15:13 to recognize his sacrifice. “Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends,” he said. Trump also used his speech to defend his decision to restrict refugees and immigration from seven   Middle East countries, calling it a “necessary” step to prevent opponents of American values from entering the country. “We will not allow a beachhead of intolerance to spread in our nation,” he said, promising to develop an immigration system to only allow people into the country who would share American values. “In the coming days, we will develop a system to help ensure that those admitted into our country fully embrace our values of religious and personal liberty and that they reject any form of oppression and discrimination,” Trump said. “We want people to come into our nation, but we want people to love us and to love our values, not to hate us and to hate our values. ” Trump spoke about his mother, who raised him with faith, and he explained that personal wealth fails to bring true happiness. “I tell you that from somebody who has had material success and knows tremendous numbers of people with great material success, the most material success,” he said. “Many of those people are very, very miserable, unhappy people, and I know a lot of people without that, but they have great families. They have great faith. ”"

[In fact, so many residents have turned against food stamps that “the city is concerned. ”  According to the San Francisco Chronicle, local Human Services Agency director Trent Rhorer has noted that “households with one illegal” are wondering how much information will reach administration officials if they use food stamps, also known as CalFresh. Eligible families also wonder “whether the administration will cut food stamp benefits to immigrants. ” Rhorer is upset by the tension. He said, “[Eligible families] are putting their household in further jeopardy of not being able to pay the rent, or not being able to pay utility bills because they have to buy food. These are benefits they are entitled to receive, and they’re playing by the rules. They shouldn’t be penalized by this negative commentary coming out of the White House. ” In the last two months the number of households withdrawing from food stamps has been well above the norm. For example, the normal drop rate is less than 60 households a month, yet “150 households withdrew from the program in March and April alone. ” Families where children are legal residents but were born to parents who came here illegally are most prone to drop CalFresh at this time, the Chronicle reports. But the city has made clear that the only people who have to provide information are the family members who apply for benefits. That is reportedly intended to limit the amount of information shared with the federal government. Under the Obama administration, Breitbart News noted at the time, the U. S. Department of Agriculture paid to run  in Mexico promoting U. S. food stamps so that when illegal aliens came to the U. S. they would be able to access the benefit.

7822,7822,26558,’Distress’ But No Apology For Epiphany Service Quran Reading,Breitbart,Donna Rachel Edmunds,1/15/17,2017,1,,"The head of the Scottish Episcopal Church has said he is “deeply distressed at the widespread offence” caused by the reading of a passage from the Quran denying the divinity of Christ during an Epiphany service, but no apology has been issued. [In a statement posted to his blog site, David Chillingworth, the Primus of the Church appeared to strongly rebuke Kelvin Holdsworth, the Provost of St Mary’s Episcopal Cathedral, Glasgow, where the reading took place, arguing that interfaith work, “like all works of reconciliation, must be founded on truth. ” He continued: “We approach others with open hearts but we stand in the truth of the gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. ”  However, no apology for the reading has been forthcoming Chillingworth reasoning that the “The decisions which have led to the situation in St Mary’s Cathedral are a matter for the Provost and the Cathedral community. ” He added that the church will “bring together all those who are involved in the development of interfaith relations” to explore how the work can be carried out “in ways which will command respect. ” Holdsworth himself is unrepentent, writing in a blog post that “local Muslim friends” were invited “as we were reflecting on the arrival of the mysterious Magi at Bethlehem”. The significance is unclear, as the Magi, predating Islam by some six centuries, were Zoroastrian. He continued: “Having a recitation from the Qur’an in a Christian cathedral in worship is not a new thing. “So it has indeed come as something of a surprise to find accounts of last week’s service appearing online and stirring up the most most incredible pot of hatred I’ve ever encountered. “This same Qur’anic reading has been given before in services and no outcry has happened. Is it because this is in a cathedral run by a gay man? Is it because the recitation was given by a young woman? “Clearly those things are factors as they feature in some of the abuse. ” Confirming that some of the messages received by the church had been reported to Police Scotland, Holdsworth added: “They assure me that intolerance and prejudice will not be tolerated in Scotland. To put it simply, I thank God for them and their work. ” The matter came to light after St Mary’s posted a video of verses of the Quran being sung in Arabic during a service to Facebook, along with a message calling it a “wonderful event. ” Both the Facebook post and a YouTube version of the reading have since been removed by the Cathedral, after it provoked widespread anger and criticism from Christians, who pointed out that the verses chosen denied the divinity of Jesus Christ as the Son of God. The reading can still be viewed elsewhere on Facebook via Madinah Javed, who sang the passages during the service. There was further anger as it emerged that a translation of the verses printed in the Order of Service and handed out to congregants omitted the last two, in which the denial came, leading to confusion. Commenting on matter on the Archbishop Cranmer blogsite, the Rev’d Dr Gavin Ashenden, Chaplain to the Queen, said: “It’s hard to know what was in the mind of the Provost of Glasgow Cathedral when he arranged for this assault on Jesus and the apostles. “The accusation of lying or deception [contained within the verses] was not just directed towards Jesus and the Apostles but is also [  …    ] to those, too, who have been martyred at the hands of Islam, because they refused to renounce this deception when confronted with it. ” Refuting Holdworth’s claims that the reading was part of an interfaith dialogue between Islam and Christianity, Ashenden continued: “There was no dialogue in the Epiphany Eucharist only a refutation of what Christians hold most dear and upon which salvation depends. “In over 30 years of interfaith conversations, I have never yet come across a Muslim community which allowed those passages in the Gospels acclaiming the divinity of Christ to be read in Friday prayers. ”"

7826,7826,26562,"Exclusive — Leading Trumpocrat: Time for Paul Ryan to Resign, ‘I Just Don’t Know How He Can Be Trusted’ - Breitbart",Breitbart,Matthew Boyle,3/26/17,2017,3,,"One of the leading Trumpocrats, Billy Bova of Mississippi, is publicly calling for House Speaker Paul Ryan to do what is right by the country and President Donald Trump by resigning his position to move out of the way of the future of the Republican Party. [Bova was one of the key activists who was a lifelong Democrat who crossed over to support Trump for president against Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton —  working with the Trumpocrats PAC, which helped flip tens of thousands of registered Democrats in the key battleground states of North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan.  In total, those states add up to 79 electoral votes —  and without them, Trump would not have won the election. In each of those states, including especially razor thin margins over Clinton in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, it was the Trumpocrats who delivered the win —  and the White House —  to President Trump. Bova made his comments in an exclusive interview on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel the morning after Ryan failed President Trump on healthcare. “I think that it is time for him to go like it was time for [former Speaker John] Boehner to go like it was time for [former Speaker Nancy] Pelosi to go,” Bova told Breitbart News Saturday. “President Trump is president because of    registered mostly lifetime Democrat voters in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan —  and those people bought into President Trump hard and were for him before they even supported him and voted for him because they love his America First populism. Our jobs first, our factories first, our legal citizens first, our military and veterans first. “Those people understand that the establishment globalist corporatists of both parties —  Republicans and Democrats —  have sold them out. They’ve sold out our working and middle class here in America. They’ve sold out our country, people born here in America who were raised up and played by the rules and paid their taxes and are just looking for a level playing field. “And they also realize that those folks that put President Trump in office, that he was correct on healthcare —  that Obamacare should be repealed but you’ve got to do it in a way that gives people choice. It’s all about competition. The insurance companies have a monopoly. I live in the state of Mississippi —  one health insurance company, Blue Cross Blue Shield, has 60 to 65 percent of the health insurance business. What if you lived in a state where AllState had 70 or 75 percent of the car insurance business? Everyone would be jumping up and down, screaming, ‘why can’t we get different insurance? I don’t need the ugly kind that they’re selling.’ So we have got to have competition in the marketplace. “And Donald Trump is right, when we get competition in the marketplace. When people go to a restaurant they don’t want two items on the menu, they want 22 items to choose from on the menu because not everybody eats the same thing and not everybody needs to consume the same kind of health insurance or health care. It’s that simple. ” Bova said that a piece from Breitbart News’ John Carney detailing how Ryan is already contradicting President Trump’s administration on tax reform, the supposed next item on the agenda, is “exactly right” and questioned how President Trump can trust Ryan as he embarks on this next step. “I don’t know how Donald Trump, President Trump and his advisers, how they are going to trust him in the future,” Bova said. “I think his credibility is basically destroyed here this past week as Speaker and as leader in the House of the Republicans on Capitol Hill. “He dropped the ball, he tried to do an Obamacare Lite so as to not step on the toes of the big insurance companies and the status quo and the Big Pharma companies and all that stuff. I don’t know they could possibly trust him to try and give us a more fair and equitable and competitive tax structure. I just don’t know how he can be trusted to do that and to lead. “It’s a shame, I’m sorry to say, but he was opposed to Donald Trump from the  . So was Mitch McConnell. Much of the leadership of the Republican Party in D. C. in the House and the Senate was opposed to him. I think they might smile and shake his hand, and slap him on the back and eat free lunch and dinner at the White House with him but I think they got back to themselves on Capitol Hill and they got their knives out again for him and for his White House and I certainly wouldn’t trust them from here on out. ” Bova said the failure of the American Health Care Act is entirely Paul Ryan’s fault, but undoubtedly Ryan’s mistakes will cause some “blowback” against President Trump. However, he added, the president can get back on track by steering clear of Ryan’s pet issues and focusing on what won him the White House. “I think what we ended up with and unfortunately, the blowback —  some of it is going to come back to the president —  but he can rebound,” Bova said. “President Trump can rebound. He’ll recapture his narrative and get back on trade and economics and jobs and that kind of thing and illegal immigration and stuff like that. “But I think what happened is Ryan and McConnell —  especially Ryan and his top people over on the House side —  figured they would just take the healthcare ball and run with it. I think this ultimately would have turned out differently if this had been Donald Trump and his top advisers and people there in the West Wing and in the White House, orchestrating it, laying it all out, writing it all out and explaining it to the people. I think we would have seen a much more different outcome than what we saw yesterday. “I think Ryan and his gang of establishment, globalist, corporatist Republicans who want the health insurance companies to charge higher and higher premiums, who want the big pharmaceutical companies to charge higher and higher prices not lower prices, who want the big insurance companies to charge a    completely healthy male another $200 a month for his health insurance because he has to have maternity leave benefits in it. “I’m in my 50s, I’ve never needed maternity leave. I’ve needed basic, major medical health insurance as a working class person —  American —    American. I don’t need a $10, 000 deductible, I need a $1, 000 deductible. “So I think it was just one more instance where the globalist, corporatist, establishment Republicans on the Hill led by Paul Ryan grabbed the ball, and took the ball and ran with it, and we ended up with this incredible debacle that unfolded this past week. ” LISTEN TO TRUMPOCRAT BILLY BOVA CALL FOR PAUL RYAN TO RESIGN: "

[On February 9 the   company cut its sales projections for the year after experiencing another quarterly decline.  The company imagined it would have flat sales but instead found a two percent decline. “For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Kellogg reported a loss of $53 million, or 15 cents per share,” the Associated Press reported on Thursday. “Not including   items, it said it earned 92 cents per share. Analysts expected a profit of 85 cents per share. Total sales were $3. 1 billion, slightly better than expected revenue of $3. 07 billion. ” But that wasn’t the only cuts Kellogg Co. reported this week. The company also told investors and employees that big cuts in facilities and workers are coming. On Wednesday the company announced it was closing a large number of distribution centers across the U. S. and that layoffs would result, WKBN reported. Some insiders have said Kellogg’s is looking to cut sales representatives, merchandisers, and shuttering as many as 39 distribution centers. Kellogg spokesman Kris Charles released a statement saying the move is a “difficult decision. ” While this is the right move for the company to achieve our   objectives, it was a difficult decision because of its impact on employees. On average, our distribution centers employ approximately 30   workers. As the distribution shifts from our network to our retailers’ networks, so too will the work. We’ve been actively engaged in conversations with some of our biggest retail partners who have expressed strong interest in hiring these employees for   roles once the transition is complete. As a result, we are optimistic that our employees will find similar employment once this transition is complete so the net impact is impossible to quantify. As the affected employees work throughout the U.

John Bryant, Kellogg Company Chairman, and CEO, said that the “retail landscape continues to change” and Kellogg has to keep up with that shift. “We have to change the way we reach and communicate with consumers. Because our customers’ and our own warehouse distribution systems have become more efficient and effective, we can now redeploy resources previously tied to DSD and direct them to the kinds of brand investments that drive greater demand with today’s consumers − ultimately growing our business and our retailers’ businesses,” he said. This latest move is on top of the major cuts already announced this year. Early in January Kellogg Co. announced it was firing 250 workers. The continued moves to scale back the company comes after Kellogg’s decided to cut its advertising with Breitbart News at the end of 2016, thereby snubbing Breitbart’s 45, 000, 000 readers. In November, Kellogg’s noted that Breitbart News’s conservative readers are not “aligned with our values as a company. ” While the decision by Kellogg’s to cease advertising made virtually no revenue impact on Breitbart. com. it did represent an escalation in the war by companies like Target and Allstate against conservative customers whose values propelled Donald Trump into the White House.

Friday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” former NBC “Nightly News” anchor Tom Brokaw advised Democrats to pick and choose their fights, including their obstruction efforts of Supreme Court justice nominee Neil Gorsuch.  “A lot of young people come up to me and say, ‘I’m just outraged by what’s going on,’” Brokaw said. “I say, ‘Rage is not a policy.’ That’s my advice to them. You’ve got to figure out what you want to do. For example, there’s going to be a big pushback about Judge Gorsuch from the Democrats. They’re going to make that one of the testing places for them. The fact is, this man has a very distinct background in the judicial world. He has a doctorate from Oxford. I have friends in the federal judiciary that don’t agree with his philosophy but say there is not a better judge in the federal circuit right now. So why pick that as a fight because who are you going to get next and what issues are you going to raise given the reality of where the Democrats are at this moment. ” According to Brokaw, Democrats have their own internal problems and not putting the effort to rebuilding their own party will be to their detriment. “They’re playing by the Republican playbook, frankly, for the last eight years,” he added. “And the other thing is, Democrats have a lot of reconstruction to do of their own party and that’s what they ought to be thinking about and that’s what they should be getting  —   they ought to be out in the middle of America saying what do we need to know from you rather than sitting in Washington, reelecting Nancy Pelosi after they lost the House three different times. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"

Every comedian tells bad jokes,” the    Seinfeld star told People magazine Tuesday.  “We all do it. That’s how we find the good jokes. So someone told a bad joke  —   so what, I don’t understand the big deal,” he added. Griffin sparked a firestorm last week when a photo taken during a shoot with L. A.  photographer Tyler Shields was published by TMZ. The photo showed the    My Life on the   star holding a decapitated prosthetic head meant to resemble that of the president in her outstretched arm. Griffin quickly apologized after the viral photo drew strong condemnation from both sides of the political aisle, writing in a Twitter message that she had gone “too far. ” In his own response, Trump called the photo “sick,” while First Lady Melania Trump described it as “very disturbing” and “simply wrong. ” In a press conference Friday, Griffin fought back tears as she accused the Trump family of bullying her and attempting to ruin her career. The comedian was fired from her role on CNN’s New Year’s Eve Live coverage in the wake of the controversy, while at least five venues on her   comedy tour scrapped her scheduled performances. The Secret Service also opened an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the photo shoot. Seinfeld wasn’t the only celebrity to come to Griffin’s defense in a speech at the premiere of his new Showtime series last week, actor Jim Carrey advised Griffin to double down on the photo by holding up Trump’s “severed leg,” adding that comics represent the “last line of defense” in a a   environment. Actor and Saturday Night Live Trump impersonator Alec Baldwin also reached out to Griffin on social media following the backlash, and advised her to ignore her critics.

7833,7833,26569,J Scott Armstrong: Fewer Than 1 Percent Of Papers in Scientific Journals Follow Scientific Method - Breitbart,Breitbart,Allum Bokhari,3/29/17,2017,3,,"Fewer than 1 percent of papers published in scientific journals follow the scientific method, according to research by Wharton School professor and forecasting expert J. Scott Armstrong. [Professor Armstrong, who   the   Journal of Forecasting in 1982 and the International Journal of Forecasting in 1985, made the claim in a presentation about what he considers to be “alarmism” from forecasters over   climate change.  “We also go through journals and rate how well they conform to the scientific method. I used to think that maybe 10 percent of papers in my field   …     were maybe useful. Now it looks like maybe, one tenth of one percent follow the scientific method” said Armstrong in his presentation, which can be watched in full below. “People just don’t do it. ” Armstrong defined eight criteria for compliance with the scientific method, including full disclosure of methods, data, and other reliable information, conclusions that are consistent with the evidence, valid and simple methods, and valid and reliable data.  According to Armstrong, very little of the forecasting in climate change debate adheres to these criteria. “For example, for disclosure, we were working on polar bear [population] forecasts, and we were asked to review the government’s polar bear forecast. We asked, ‘could you send us the data’ and they said ‘No’  …     So we had to do it without knowing what the data were. ” According to Armstrong, forecasts from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) violate all eight criteria. “Why is this all happening? Nobody asks them!” said Armstrong, who says that people who submit papers to journals are not required to follow the scientific method. “You send something to a journal and they don’t tell you what you have to do. They don’t say ‘here’s what science is, here’s how to do it. ’” Digging deeper into their motivations, Armstrong pointed to the wealth of incentives for publishing papers with politically convenient rather than scientific conclusions. “They’re rewarded for doing   research. One of my favourite examples is testing statistical significance  —   that’s invalid. It’s been over 100 years we’ve been fighting the fight against that. Even its inventor thought it wasn’t going to amount to anything. You can be rewarded then, for following an invalid [method]. ” “They cheat. If you don’t get statistically significant results, then you throw out variables, add variables, [and] eventually you get what you want. ” “My big thing is advocacy. People are asked to come up with certain answers, and in our whole field that’s been a general movement ever since I’ve been here, and it just gets worse every year. And the reason is funded research. ” “I’ve [gone through] my whole career, with lots of publications, and I’ve never gotten a research grant. And I’m proud of that now. ” Armstrong concluded his talk by arguing that scientific evidence should be required for all climate regulations.

C. this week, abortion provider Planned Parenthood has released an animated video of its own   history narrated by celebrities including Lena Dunham, Meryl Streep and Mindy Kaling. [Dunham, the creator and star of HBO’s Girls and a   activist, shared the Planned Parenthood anniversary video on her Twitter account Tuesday morning.  “This is the story of the incredible women who sacrificed everything to bring us safe and affordable reproductive health care,” the video’s opening title card reads. I made this video   @mindykaling, @amyschumer, @TessaThompson_x, Meryl Streep  more because we show up for @PPFA: https:  .   —   Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) January 17, 2017,  The video guides viewers through the early days of the organization and details the life of its founder, Margaret Sanger. “Margaret knew how to work the press,” narrates Mindy Kaling, the star of Hulu’s The Mindy Project. “When she chose jail time over fines for running a birth control clinic, her case became a national sensation. ” After reeling off a few statistics about Planned Parenthood today, Dunham recalled that Sanger had “aligned herself with eugenicists. ” “It doesn’t seem to make sense,” Dunham says. “But way back in the early 20th century, eugenics was an immensely popular social movement, one with the kind of widespread legitimacy Margaret craved for her own birth control campaign. ” “Let’s make something clear,” Dunham adds. “Racism and ableism do not have a place at Planned Parenthood, and sure as hell don’t represent the organization’s commitment to equality. While there’s no question that Margaret left behind a conflicting legacy, it’s also true that she was a champion of progress. ” The video discusses the invention of the birth control pill and the significance of 1973’s Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision, before ending with a pledge to continue providing abortion care to women across the United States. “In our first 100 years, Planned Parenthood helped establish what reproductive rights are and why they’re so critically important,” the video concludes. “In the next 100, we will keep fighting until we make sure they’re available to everyone. ” Other celebrities lending their talent to the clip include Amy Schumer, Tessa Thompson, America Ferrera, Jennifer Lawrence, Gina Rodriguez and Constance Wu. J. J. Abrams is listed as an executive producer, while Dunham’s boyfriend, guitarist Jack Antonoff, provided the music. Watch the clip above.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum"
7835,7835,26571,Mexico Ranked Second Deadliest Country in the World,Breitbart,Ryan Saavedra,5/10/17,2017,5,,"As the total number of conflict fatalities decreased around the world in 2016, the number of intentional homicides exploded in Mexico. [With 23, 000 homicides in 2016, Mexico ranked as the second deadliest country in the world, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) revealed in their Armed Conflict Survey.  The report, published on Tuesday, highlighted the effect that drug cartels are having in Latin America. Leading the way are Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador: This assessment of violence in the region is based on more than numbers, although the 39, 000 people killed in Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador in 2016 indicate a security crisis much more complex and serious than most other countries in the region. Mexico’s 2016 intentional homicide total, 23, 000, is second only to Syria.   …     In all four countries, armed forces have been deployed for many years specifically to fight criminal gangs and, in the case of Mexico, transnational   cartels, with   weapons and vast financial resources. In all four countries, criminal groups have ambitious territorial claims: they fight amongst themselves and use arms to challenge the state directly for local control. Unlike traditional political conflicts, these criminal conflicts are fought to establish autonomous territories, not to pursue national   goals. 2016 marked the second consecutive year that the number of conflict fatalities decreased around the world, CNN noted. Despite the decrease of 10, 000 conflict fatalities from 2015 to 2016, Mexico’s homicide rate is accelerating: As the Armed Conflict Survey shows, intentional homicides jumped by 22. 8% from 2015 to 2016. Violence continues to increase. The first two months of 2017 were the most violent January and February on record, with 3, 779 homicide cases registered by the authorities. The following month was even worse: March 2017 saw 2, 020 murders. This was the highest monthly tally since June 2011, a bloody moment in the midst of Mexico’s ‘war on drugs’. In December 2006, President Felipe Calderon deployed the armed forces to the streets with the mission of crushing the cartels. But the resulting conflict brought misery to Mexico: 105, 000 people lost their lives in intentional homicides between that month and November 2012. Compounding the drug war is the corruption within the Mexican government. The organization that has the largest influence is the Sinaloa Cartel, which the U. S. Department of Justice (DOJ) identifies as the largest and most prolific in the world. Court documents filed by the DOJ against Mexican drug kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, state that corrupting government officials was the cornerstone of the cartel’s success, Breitbart Texas reported. In the 2016 National Drug Threat Assessment, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) reported, “Mexican TCOs [Drug Cartels] remain the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States no other group is currently positioned to challenge them. ” Despite the risk that Mexican drug cartels pose to the national security of U. S. many Democratic politicians, and even some Republican politicians are opposed to building walls along the U. S.  Border. In April, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( ) said, “The president, I think, talking about this wall, is expressing a sign of weakness. He is saying I can’t control our borders, I have to build a wall. ” Not to be outdone by Pelosi, Sen. Dick Durbin ( ) said the proposed U. S.  Border wall was “a political stunt. ” Ryan Saavedra is a contributor for Breitbart Texas and can be found on Twitter at @RealSaavedra."

7838,7838,26574,Rep. Phil Roe: House Healthcare Bill ‘Giant Step’ in Process of Replacing Obamacare,Breitbart,John Hayward,5/5/17,2017,5,,"Rep. Phil Roe ( ) talked about his vote in favor of the American Health Care Act (AHCA) with SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Friday’s Breitbart News Daily. [Kassam observed that the Breitbart News Daily audience appeared to be leaning “about 60 percent against” the AHCA because they do not see it as a full repeal of Obamacare or a bold enough step toward getting government out of the health insurance industry.  “A yes vote was an obvious vote for me because the ACA is failing,” said Roe, referring to Obamacare by its legislative name, the Affordable Care Act. “A third of my district this coming year  —   maybe more  —   have no options whatsoever. We’re going to be an Obamacare desert in Tennessee within a year. There’s not going to be anywhere to buy insurance on the ACA. So it’s failed, just like it has in Iowa, just like it is in many places across the country. ”  “The premiums have skyrocketed. The    have gone up. I’ll give you an example locally, the hospital where I practiced for over 30 years,” Rep. Roe, who is a retired medical doctor who also served in the U. S. Army Medical Corps, said. “It’s a large system, a   system: 9, 000 employees 60 to 70 percent of the uncollectable debt are people with insurance  —   not without insurance, with insurance. Their   and    are skyrocketed, and they can’t pay the bills. ” “It wasn’t a matter of not doing anything,” said Roe. “The Republican Study Committee asked me two terms ago to write an alternative to the Affordable Care Act, which I did, and I did it again in the last Congress. We put our ideas out there. ” He said the implementation of those ideas was limited by congressional rules and the large number of votes required to pass a bill. “I agree with people: if I’d have had my way and a magic wand, this bill would have looked differently,” he conceded. “There would have been more free market principles in it. But we got as far as we could get and get the votes. ”  “And by the way, that vote would have been stronger  —   we were five representatives short on our side yesterday,” he added. “We had five people, one out for personal reasons, and then four out in the Trump administration. People have forgotten that in the 2010 vote, the Democrats had 257, not 237, and they passed it by five votes, I believe. So it was a similar vote. Big things like this are hard to do. I understand people’s frustration that it didn’t go far enough. Believe me, this was a giant step, in my opinion  —   positive, not negative. ” Kassam asked about the AHCA’s potential to defund Planned Parenthood and whether such a provision has a chance of surviving in the Senate. “We’ll have to see what the Senate does,” replied Roe. “My hat’s off to them. This is hard work. Look, we spent hours and hours and hours getting to where we were, getting to 216 votes with hiccups and starts. ” “I am a   obstetrician,” he declared. “I’ve delivered almost 5, 000 babies in my career before I retired and ran for Congress. Money from the federal government ought to go into health care. What we decided, we have 141 federally qualified health centers that provide health care in the state of Tennessee and three Planned Parenthood clinics. So we want to put that money where health care is going on, not abortions. ”  “This was a   step. We’ll see what the Senate does. I think most of us are very happy about that, Raheem,” he said. Roe noted that Planned Parenthood provides services other than abortion. “They do sexually transmitted disease screening. They do breast exams, pap smears,” he said. However, he added, “I don’t think any of their clinics actually do mammograms. I think they refer those out. ” “I know this was a big part for some people but a relatively small part of that whole package,” he said of the Planned Parenthood funding issue. “In the state of Tennessee  —   I got this off of the Planned Parenthood website it’s not a number I’m making up  —    they did 918 breast exams in 2016 in the three clinics in the state of Tennessee. I saw myself, just one doctor, between three and four thousand patients a year, every year. ” Roe disagreed with the criticism that the AHCA merely does some “tweaking” of Obamacare, as Kassam put it, rather than substantially repealing the ACA. “Remember, this is only the first part of this, Raheem,” Roe reiterated. “This is all we could get in reconciliation, meaning it just takes 51 votes in the Senate. Again, I go back to the Senate rules. We were hamstrung because of what we could do. We passed already across state lines and association health plans. That’s already been passed over to the Senate. Now, the Senate will filibuster that. ”  “I’m not saying there are not ways you can get around it and do it. Remember, we have a Secretary of HHS, Tom Price, who can also do a lot of things just executively with the stroke of a pen,” he added.  “What we’re trying to do  —   and I did a terrible job of this when we first debated the healthcare bill  —   this part of the market we’re talking about, this individual and   market, is seven percent of the entire insurance market,” said Roe, adding that “160 million of us get our insurance through our employer. There are already ERISA protections in there for   conditions. There is no   exclusion if you have Medicaid, which 74 million people do. ”  “And by the way, this is the first major reform of Medicaid in decades, maybe since it was established,” he continued. “About 57 million people get insurance through Medicare, where there is no   condition exclusion. What we tried to do was create a market in that seven percent to reconstruct the small market. It’s been destroyed by Obamacare. I mean, we have well over a third of the counties in this country, of the 3, 000 or so counties in America, that only have one choice, and that’s going up every day. That market has been destroyed. This will help recreate it. ” Roe said there were other free   features of the Obamacare replacement bill worth praising, such as the expansion of health savings accounts.  “This is just the beginning,” he promised. “Look, if I could have taken the bill I had written and passed it with 216 votes, as written, it would look different. We want to recreate a situation where doctors and patients are making choices, not bureaucrats. ”  “If we fail at this, if we fail with making it where it’s cheaper, where more people can buy insurance, and the quality goes up, then we will have failed. I admit that fully. I think we can hit those targets, and I believe you can do that,” he said. “This is my third iteration of healthcare reform. I was involved in the Tenncare reform in the nineties in Tennessee, which was a failure,” Roe recalled. “I wrote an editorial in 2010, Raheem, about what I thought would happen to the ACA because of what I had seen almost 20 years before, and it exactly came true. ”  Roe argued that Obamacare has failed, according to its own standards and goals. “It’s intention was to increase access and decrease costs. Well, the costs have just gone through the roof. If we don’t do something with the cost of health care in this country, nobody is going to be able to afford it,” he warned.

What if CO2 is causing dramatic climate change and we as humans are responsible?” Pruitt just didn’t know how to respond. There should have been nothing complicated or unexpected about these questions. They are the kind of thing any   decent interviewer might have asked, be he a hostile one or a   Fox News one playing devil’s advocate. And if Scott Pruitt had had even the most cursory briefing and media training in his new role, he should have been prepared for them. Not only should he have known the most effective answers to give but he should have been so confident in the rightness and truth of his cause that he should have been able to seize the moment and make the points that really need to be made about President Trump’s environmental policy: that it is being enacted for the good of science, for the good of the economy and the core mission of Making America Great Again. How could Scott Pruitt not do this? Any one of us on the skeptical side of the argument could have pointed him to dozens of leading scientists  —   and hundreds if not thousands of papers and articles  —   that could easily have enabled Pruitt to say what needed to be said. He could have noted the incompetence, corruption, and mendacity of the heavily politicized IPCC the dishonest manipulation by organizations like NOAA  —   indeed especially NOAA  —   of the raw temperature data the utter meaninglessness of the “hottest year evah” claims so often made in the liberal media. And he could easily have batted off the “What if you’re wrong?” question by making perhaps the most important point of all that needs to be made about the “war” on “carbon”: that what it all comes down to is cost benefit analysis. To whit: the trillions of dollars being spent every year on the possibility that there might be a problem, a) could be spent much more usefully elsewhere and b) are doing more harm than good. Pruitt was incapable of doing this though because, trained lawyer though he is, he is simply not on top of his brief. This is disgraceful. It’s an embarrassment and a shambles. Worst of all, it’s an entirely needless concession to the enemy. See how it’s being reported by the   propaganda site Think Progress."

[“Bob Beckel was terminated today for making an insensitive remark to an   employee,” Fox said in a statement Friday.  Beckel, an outspoken liberal who had served as Walter Mondale’s 1984 presidential campaign manager, was frequently in hot water during his time at Fox, particularly for his occasional   cursing and controversial remarks. Beckel was a   of The Five, as well as an occasional guest on other Fox programs.

7844,7844,26580,China: Sean Spicer ’Not in a Position’ to Call South China Sea ’International Territory’ - Breitbart,Breitbart,Frances Martel,1/26/17,2017,1,,"The Chinese government has continued to protest the Trump administration’s repeated assurances it would oppose China’s ongoing colonization of international waters in the South China Sea, most recently challenging White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer for calling the waters in question “international territory. ”[“I don’t think he [Spicer] is in a position to say that that’s international territory,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told NBC News in an interview. “There might be difference, or controversial claims over the sovereignty of those islands, but that’s not for the United States. That might be between China and some other countries in this region. ”  Lu’s remarks on bilateral relations with the United States were significantly sharper in tone than those of his boss, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who said in recent remarks that Beijing’s Communist Party would like to “increase mutual trust, focus cooperation, manage and control disputes and promote the healthy development of   relations, to bring even greater benefits to both peoples. ” Spicer had said during his regular press briefing on Monday that the United States would play a role in protecting the territorial integrity of the South China Sea. “If those islands are, in fact, in international waters and not part of China proper, yeah, we’ll make sure we defend international interests from being taken over by one country. ” Spicer’s comments appeared to irritate Chinese officials still objecting to remarks by incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson about the region. In a Senate hearing otherwise largely devoid of definitive answers on major international disputes, Tillerson vowed to play a role in protecting the interests of nations whose land and sea China claimed as its own in the region. “We’re going to have to send China a clear signal that, first, the   stops and, second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed,” he told a Senate committee, comparing China’s usurpation of South China Sea territory to Russia’s invasion and colonization of Crimea. China claims the territory within a border Beijing refers to as the “  line. ” Within that line is territory belonging to the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Brunei, and Malaysia, as well as some waters close to Natuna Island, Indonesia. China has constructed numerous artificial islands in the Spratly and Paracel Islands and the Scarborough Shoal, challenging the sovereignty of the Philippines and Vietnam. China has filled some of those islands with military assets, which the United States has repeatedly protested as threat to the international community. China’s official party line on the region appears to be that only the United States continues to protest their presence in waters not belonging to sovereign China. “Countries have already come back to the original agreement that maybe for the time being we could set aside those sovereign disputes, and focus on some joint developments, and working together to maintain the peace and stability in this region,” Lu told NBC. Lu appeared to mostly be referring to the Philippines, which won a case at the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague over China’s illegal construction, but has since backed down of its objection to China’s territorial pursuits under President Rodrigo Duterte. His predecessor, Benigno Aquino, was the one to bring the case to the Hague. While the Trump administration appears to be making the liberation of the colonized South China Sea a priority, President Barack Obama had also engaged China on the matter. Former Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter attended military exercises in the region and often repeated the U. S. policy of having the American military “fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows. ” The Defense Department also staged numerous “freedom of navigation” exercises in the region, much to China’s chagrin. Critics argue, however, that the Obama administration’s guest passages through the South China Sea did not actively challenge China’s adverse possession claims on the artificial islands and, as such, were more of a “PR stunt” than effective deterrence."

[Six   of pigs heads were discovered on the gates of the building in Genlis, a small town near Dijon, France on Friday morning. Further to the pig heads, further “cold cuts” of pork were discovered thrown into the yard.  France’s Le Figaro reports the comments of the local Mayor, who said the Association of Socioculture and Muslim Culture of Genlis (ASCMG) had “acquired this building with the aim of making it a place of worship in the future. This announcement, made in the regional press last week, had unleashed [bad feelings]”. The mayor told the paper he condemned the act of placing pig parts on the mosque and that he supported the work of the association. Speaking this morning, he remarked: “[The police] have taken samples and I hope the person or people of this act will be held accountable  …     hatred linked to religion has no place in our commune where everyone must live in full harmony and respect for each other”.   Socialist politician Kheira Bouziane supported the mayor’s position, remarking: “The ASCMG has been promoting a peaceful   dialogue since 2013  …     today’s insult aims to divide”.   activist group spokesman Maryna Schcherbyna joined the mayor in a call for punishment, remarking this afternoon: “SOS Racisme  …     demands that justice be done”. She also referred to a 2016 case in the same town where the   Georges Grossel had called in a Facebook post for pork to be served in canteens. SOS Racisme demanded his resignation at the time  —   he was suspended from the mayorality and fined €2, 000. Local broadcaster Le Bien Public reports the attack comes two days before a public consultation is due to be held on the project. The Dijon prosecutor has opened an investigation into what is being termed as a public provocation of discrimination or racial hatred, although police presently have no leads to pursue. The Genlis case follows a significant number of other cases across Europe where Islamic centres of worship were defaced with pig parts. In Islam, pigs and their meat are considered unclean, or “haram” and the leaving of bacon and other meat at mosques is considered a   and in some cases severely punished. Breitbart London reported in 2016 on the placement of a pig’s head on the steps of the office of German Chancellor Angela Merkel in protest against her policy of mass migration from predominantly Muslim countries.

[“China always respects the freedom of navigation and overflight all littoral countries enjoy under international law,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a daily news briefing, according to Reuters.  “But we are consistently opposed to relevant countries threatening and damaging the sovereignty and security of littoral countries under the flag of freedom of navigation and overflight,” Geng said. “We hope relevant countries can do more to safeguard regional peace and stability. ” China has built multiple islands in the sea and claims almost all its   waters  —   although Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam all claim parts of it  —   and about $5 trillion worth of trade passes through the sea each year. The U. S. has criticized China’s construction of the islands, as well as a   of military facilities on the islands. The U. S. Navy sent the USS Carl Vinson, along with its strike group, through the South China Sea on Saturday, to conduct “routine operations. ” Prior to arriving in the South China Sea, the strike group conducted training off the islands of Hawaii and Guam, the Navy said. “The training completed over the past few weeks has really brought the team together and improved our effectiveness and readiness as a strike group,” said Rear Adm. James Kilby, commander of the strike group. “We are looking forward to demonstrating those capabilities while building upon existing strong relationships with our allies, partners, and friends in the    region,” he said. The last time the Vinson deployed to the South China Sea was in 2015, to conduct a bilateral exercise with the Royal Malaysian Navy and Royal Malaysian Air Force, the Navy said in a statement. The Vinson first operated in the South China Sea in 1983 and has operated there during 16 previous deployments over its   history, it added. Other U. S. ships have navigated the South China Sea last year, to counter China’s claims of sovereignty, but this deployment was the first under President Trump. The Vinson’s deployment to the area comes about two weeks after a Chinese aircraft that patrols the skies and detects threats flew within 1, 000 feet of a U. S. surveillance aircraft. Pentagon officials had played that event down as unintentional. It also comes after a Navy plan was sent up to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to increase operations in the area, although it’s not clear if it has been approved yet. The plan would see the U. S. conducting “Freedom of Navigation Operations,” or FONOPs, within 12 nautical miles of the islands, within what China claims is its territorial waters. Mattis signaled support for a potential increase in FONOPs during a press conference on Feb. 4 while in Japan. “Freedom of navigation is absolute, and whether it be commercial shipping or our U. S. Navy, we will practice in international waters and transit international waters as appropriate,” he said."

On Jan. 11, the   rights publication the Washington Blade published a story entitled, “10 ways Obama promoted LGBT rights abroad. ” Those moves by the Obama administration’s State Department included: Mark Toner, acting spokesman at State, clarified on Thursday the proposed percentage of cuts at State. “There’s a little bit of confusion about that, so let me try to clarify it,” Toner said. “The FY 2018 budget requests 25. 6 billion in base funding for the Department of State and USAID, and that’s a 10. 1 billion or 28 percent reduction from the FY 2017 continuing resolution level. ” “So that’s a 28 percent reduction without the overseas contingency operations funding,” Toner said. “So the budget also requests, obviously, 12 billion as overseas contingency operations funding for a total request of 37. 6 billion, which represents an overall reduction of 17. 3 billion. ” “That’s 31 percent from the annualized  —   or from the CR level, which is base and OCO funds,” Toner said. “So just to simplify it, the two variations there  —   the 28 percent is the amount of reduction without OCO, which is the overseas contingency operations funding. ” “The 31 percent number or figure is with that overseas contingency operations funding,” Toner said. The Los Angeles Times suggested in its reporting on Thursday that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was not concerned with the budget cuts, rather than characterizing his remarks as compatible with President Trump’s assessment that the Department has been overfunded in the past. “But the head of the department, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, seemed unconcerned Thursday,” the Times reported. “The level of spending that the State Department has been undertaking in the past  —   and particularly in this past year  —   is simply not sustainable,” Tillerson said at a brief news conference in Tokyo, the first stop on a     tour of Asia. “Tillerson, for most of his career a top executive at Exxon Mobil, said he expected more aid from other countries would help to cover the shortfall as the U. S. recedes, and he said he was ‘confident’ the State Department would continue to fulfill its mission,” the Times reported. “We are going to be undertaking a very comprehensive examination of how programs are executed, a very comprehensive examination of how we are structured, and I’m confident that with the input of the men and women of the State Department, we are going to construct a way forward that allows us to be much more effective, much more efficient and be able to do a lot with fewer dollars,” Tillerson said. “We understand the challenge,” Tillerson said. “I take the challenge that the president has given us on willingly and with great expectation that with everyone in the State Department’s assistance, we’re going to deliver a much better result for the American people in the future. ”"

S. in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2003. [The Los Angeles Times reports: “Ten Gold Star families   …     held hands, they prayed and they revealed nightmarish memories of learning about the deaths of their loved ones  —   openly sharing so that they can continue to heal. ”  A crowd of about 300 gathered for the ceremony. The memorial has been expanded each year. The memorial’s website explains: This is the nation’s first memorial dedicated exclusively to listing the names of all the fallen American service members in Afghanistan and Iraq. Since 2003, a simple memorial for the country’s military fallen in Afghanistan and Iraq was set up in the Southern California city of Irvine by members of the community on the week before Memorial Day and then removed the week after Independence Day. For years the community and visitors from all over the country have come to share in the fellowship at the site of the Northwood Gratitude and Honor Memorial. The names of every service member who has died in Afghanistan and Iraq had been displayed on the wooden posts of the temporary memorial. Now their names are engraved in granite in a permanent memorial, to assure that future generations of Americans will remember and honor them with gratitude as we do today. The panels carry the names of all those who died in Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn. One participant stressed the importance of helping those who died after they returned home, through the ongoing challenge of veteran suicide. Other ceremonies to remember the fallen will continue throughout California on Memorial Day, particularly at the many national cemeteries across the Golden State, including Bakersfield, Fort Rosecrans, Golden Gate, Los Angeles, Miramar, Riverside, Sacramento Valley, San Francisco, and San Joaquin Valley.

7863,7863,26599,Donald Trump’s ’Comprehensive Immigration Reform’ is Much Broader Than Expected - Breitbart,Breitbart,Neil Munro,1/26/17,2017,1,,"The new immigration reforms announced Jan. 25 by President Donald Trump include a comprehensive range of measures that put the full weight of the federal government behind his campaign promise to shut down illegal immigration. [The extensive reforms of rules against illegal immigration were unpacked Wednesday afternoon by alarmed immigration lawyers, including Greg Siskind and David Leopold, a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. The association’s members help bring roughly one million legal immigrants and roughly one million temporary contract workers into the United States each year.  Here’s a list of very important measures hidden in the details. For example, immigration officers are being allowed the    ability to enforce the law as they see fit. Under Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, the officers were merely robots under the slow and   control of D.  “civil rights” lawyers, whose first priorities were the political interests of their   political bosses. Trump’s Exec Order gives low level ICE bureaucrats unchecked power to declare someone an #immigration enforcement priority. Outrageous,  —   David Leopold (@DavidLeopold) January 25, 2017,  A Bloomberg columnist underlined the importance of the new freedom for officers. Ex Order on Sanctuaries may not budge local govts but makes every undoc immig a target for removal. Empowers   agents to judge.  —   Francis Wilkinson (@fdwilkinson) January 25, 2017,    Garance is the    of Yahoo. com’s politics news service. She highlighted a report showing that the broader rules help immigration officers to send illegals home after committing common crimes, such as identity theft. Thats very different from Obama’s policies, which limited deportations to illegals who committed felonies or major violent crimes. Trump EO also dramatically expands ”criminal” category for purposes of deportation https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Garance   (@thegarance) January 25, 2017,  Siskind Tweeted his analysis of Trump’s orders, section by section. Section 1 states that people who enter the US without inspection threaten  ”national security and public safety” .  —   (((Greg Siskind))) (@gsiskind) January 25, 2017,  This Tweet those that by declaring illegal immigrants to be national security threats, Trump offers immigration agencies more legal pathways to quickly return the migrants to their homelands, sometime bypassing civil lawsuits.   Section 3. Definitions. ot much interesting here except ”wall” is defined as a wall or a fence. Hah! ”operational control” means zero entries,  —   (((Greg Siskind))) (@gsiskind) January 25, 2017,  That’s an important indication of support for a fence, versus a wall. Border officers say a fence is better than a wall, because it allows them to spot approaching problems through the fence. Also, Trump’s decision to set”operational control” at zero means that zero illegal crosses is the desired and very ambitious measure of success.   c. project and develop   funding to build the wall including congressional budget requests (wait  —   I thought Mexico was paying? ).  —   (((Greg Siskind))) (@gsiskind) January 25, 2017,  Okay, by saying Congress will fund construction and staffing of the barrier, Trump commits himself to finding other   funds to offset Congress’ checks. Those funds could include taxes on money sent to Mexico by illegal immigrants, or maybe even savings from welfare funds no longer being spent on illegal migrants.   Section 6. Detention for Illegal Entry. DHS will detain apprehended people until the outcome of their removal proceedings (already happens).  —   (((Greg Siskind))) (@gsiskind) January 25, 2017,  This detention requirement is huge because it means the end of President Barack Obama’s   “catch and release” policy. The Obama policy has forced officers to release many migrants once they cross the border, allowing the migrants to join their extended families throughout the United States. In contrast, Trump’s plan will deter migrants, who will know that if they are caught, they must spend days or months in U. S. detention facilities before being sent home to face unpaid and angry coyotes.   Section 7. Return to Territory. DHS shall ensure people are returned 2 the place from which they came pending a formal removal proceeding if,  —   (((Greg Siskind))) (@gsiskind) January 25, 2017,  That’s also big, because it means that Trump will return migrants home until lawyers and perhaps courts decide if they can win asylum in the United States. That initial return will also deter migration because migrants will know they can’t get a job in the United States while their legal claims are processed over months or years.   Section 9. Foreign Aid Reporting Requirements. Agencies will review all sources of aid to Mexico over the last five years.  —   (((Greg Siskind))) (@gsiskind) January 25, 2017,  Here’s where Trump’s deputies are building more leverage against Mexico. By calculating where the aid money is going, they’ll be able to nudge the Mexican government towards   payments  —   or face the additional threat of losing aid funds.   Local law enforcement officials will have authority to perform the functions of immigration officers.  —   (((Greg Siskind))) (@gsiskind) January 25, 2017,  This is important too, because it means the Justice Department can fund state and local cops to pick up illegal immigrants for repatriation by the Department of Homeland Security. This rule means that illegals living far from the border can now expect repatriation orders when they’re arrested for minors crimes, such as   fights, thefts, and other offenses that have been ignored by deputies working for Obama and Bush.   Section 11. Parole, Asylum and Removal. ”It is the policy of the exec branch to end the abuse of parole and asylum provisions currently( )  —   (((Greg Siskind))) (@gsiskind) January 25, 2017,  This “parole” rule shuts an   backdoor created by Obama’s deputies. Under Obama, many illegals were given permission to return to the United States under “parole” prior to taking a quick trip home. This early permission meant that the illegals  —   including many students enrolled in American colleges  —   could   the United States legally and then start applying for various forms of residency and amnesty.   DHS shall take actions to ensure asylum   fear screenings conducted in manner consistent w plain language of those provisions,  —   (((Greg Siskind))) (@gsiskind) January 25, 2017,  This “plain language” rule shuts down Obama’s   program for allowing Central American migrants into the United States. So far, at least 350, 000 unskilled Central American migrants have been allowed to apply by asylum by claiming they have a “credible fear” of violence if they return home.   Sec. 16. Hiring. OPM will facilitate hiring to implement the order.  —   (((Greg Siskind))) (@gsiskind) January 25, 2017,  This hiring rule means that Trump’s top deputies will use of the White House’s Office of Personnel Management to pick the people tasked with enforcing the new policy. This   direction can help bypass bureaucratic opposition within various agencies. Officials have already announced the hiring of a D. C.    lobbyist to help run the Customs and Border Protection agency. “Julie Kirchner, the former executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) has been named chief of staff at U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) the largest federal law enforcement agency of the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS),” said a Jan. 23 statement from the   Southern Poverty Law Center. The new rules also create a new office to help spotlight the suffering of Americans attacked by illegal immigrants. That p. r. office will provide a steady supply of news and drama to focus public attention on crimes by illegal immigrants  —   and it will also help defeat claims by advocates of immigration that Trump is breaking up families of illegal immigrants. Trump presented the p. r. strategy at his Wednesday speech where he talked up his new rules. He told his cheering audience at the Department of Homeland Security that: For years the media has largely ignored the stories of Americans and lawful residents victimized by open borders. To all of those hurting out there, I repeat to you these words. We hear you, we see you and you will never, ever be ignored again. As I travel the country, I had the chance to get to know mothers who have lost their children to violence spilling over the border. I want to thank the Remembrance Project  —   such incredible people  —   for giving these families a voice. They are called Angel Mom’s for good reason because they are a voice to protect all of America’s children. Their children have not died in vain, believe me. Pundits talk about how enforcing immigration laws can separate illegal immigrant families, but the families they don’t talk about are the families of Americans. Forever separated from the people they love, they don’t talk about that ever. As your president, I have no higher duty than to protect the lives of the American people. Overall, Siskind, Leopold and other advocates of   diversity say Trump’s popular reforms are a disaster for their political goals. That’s it. Now go out and let your legislators know this is terrible.  —   (((Greg Siskind))) (@gsiskind) January 25, 2017,  The President is now in violation of his oath of office.  —   David Leopold (@DavidLeopold) January 20, 2017,  However, Trump has yet to announce many of the other labor and immigration reforms he promised during the election. Top of the list is a new law from Congress requiring companies to check that possible hires are allowed to work in the United States. The reformers also want Trump to deploy a   system so that officials know when legal visitors, such as tourists or temporary workers, have left the country. The system would help reduce the number of “overstay” illegal workers. Congress has repeatedly authorized the deployment of the tracking system since the   atrocity, but has not provided the needed funds. In 2015 roughly 500, 000 foreign visitors overstayed their visas, according to a government report. The reformers also want Trump to reverse Obama regulations which sharply increased the inflow of foreign   professionals who compete for professional jobs sought by young American graduates. Trump is coming under criticism from   immigration reformers for not immediately stopping the renewal of   work permits given to roughly 750, 000 illegal immigrants by Obama’s 2012  . Throughout his term, Obama increased the inflow of legal immigrants so much that his agencies brought one migrant into the United States for every two births during the first half of 2016, according to the Center for Immigration Studies. For much of his tenure, Obama’s agencies annually imported one million new legal immigrants plus one million foreign contract workers, even as 4 million young Americans annually entered the job market. By a lopsided margin, most Americans believe companies should hire Americans before hiring additional immigrants. Trump’s   policies are mostly opposed by business groups and by many GOP leaders, especially House Speaker Paul Ryan. The GOP’s leadership tend to favor a       economic strategy. For example, Ryan has repeatedly argued that business needs an extra supply of foreign   workers and   professionals above the natural supply of four million Americans who join the labor force each year, and he argues that foreign workers are needed to prevent any wage increases for American workers. The current inflow of cheap foreign workers cuts’ Americans salaries and effectively transfers roughly $500 billion a year from pay packets into investors’ profits, according to calculations by Professor George Borjas, a Harvard researcher.

7865,7865,26601,Showdown! NFL MVP Matt Ryan Leads Falcons Against Tom Brady and the Patriots - Breitbart,Breitbart,Daniel Leberfeld,2/4/17,2017,2,,"Sports play as an escape from real world negativity. Unfortunately, the sports and political worlds collide quite a bit recently. [Whatever your political persuasion, the actual game on Super Bowl Sunday should prove fun to watch. Neither the cast of the Mike   musical Hamilton singing “America the Beautiful” pregame nor   Lady Gaga performing the halftime show, or commercials with political agendas, can ruin a game, featuring two great quarterbacks, New England’s Tom Brady and Atlanta’s Matt Ryan.  Let’s take a closer look at the football game, which likely plays as a nice   escape from political football. One of the great   in this contest features Ryan against a superb Patriots secondary: cornerbacks Malcolm Butler and Logan Ryan, along with safeties Devin McCourty and Patrick Chung. They all play on a high level. However, the Patriots’ secondary faces a Herculian challenge against the Falcons’ coterie of   weapons, led by wide receiver Julio Jones, who averaged more than 100 receiving yards a game this season. If you take away Jones, Ryan happily targets other talented wideouts such as Mo Sanu or speedy Taylor Gabriel, or perhaps one of three talented tight ends. “As a defensive coordinator, you really have to pick your poison, and decide what you want to take away,” Jones said. And the poison includes a tailback tandem that can hurt you running and receiving. Atlanta’s dynamic duo of Davonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman combined for 2, 482 yards and 24 touchdowns this season. This pair of powerful runners are passing game weapons as well, combining for 85 receptions and 883 yards. The Patriots aren’t easy to run against with a cornucopia of talented, massive defensive linemen such as Alan Branch and Malcolm Brown. “They have big heavy guys up front that are ” said Falcons center Alex Mack. And Mack, Atlanta’s outstanding center, isn’t healthy. He’s dealing with a painful left fibula injury, and will probably need a Toradol shot to get through the game. “I’m concerned,” Falcons coach Dan Quinn said about Mack. “I’m not panicked, but I’m concerned. ” With a   quarterback and a coterie of weapons, the Falcons certainly shouldn’t struggle scoring, but they can score enough? Can they keep up with the Brady? While Atlanta’s defense has improved from early in the season, it’s still not an elite unit. In their regular season finale, a   win over New Orleans, Saints QB Drew Brees threw for 350 yards, wide receiver Michael Thomas snagged 10 catches for 156 yards and tailback Mark Ingram rushed for 102 yards. After watching this tape, Brady likely chomps at the bit. The Falcons start three defensive rookies  —   safety Keanu Neal and linebackers De’Vondre Campbell and Deion Jones. They also feature a rookie nickel back, Brian Poole, who plays a lot. Brady is superb at manipulating defenders with his eyes  —   throwing them off the trail of where he intends to throw. Rookies are particularly vulnerable to this chicanery. Expect Brady to target these rookies. “Brady is going to find out what the kids know,” said SiriusXM NFL Radio analyst Pat Kirwan. “I would expect him to [go after the rookies],” said Neal. “I would expect him to go to a guy that doesn’t have as much as experience as others. ” Neal embraces the challenge. “Bring it on,” Neal said. “I’m not scared. ” Be careful what you wish for. Brady, looking for his fifth Super Bowl victory, is coming off a virtuoso performance vs. Pittsburgh in the AFC Championship Game, throwing for 384 yards and three touchdowns. At 39, Brady is still at the top of his game, and wants to play six more years. “You combine his competitiveness, his preparation, his accuracy and his toughness with his memory, you’ve got the best quarterback to ever play,” Houston Texans coach Bill O’Brien, a former Patriots assistant, told the Boston Herald. A good way to mess with Brady is with interior pressure. “The best way to disrupt [his] rhythm has always been pressuring Brady from the center of the pocket,” Falcons coach Dan Quinn said. “Many times, when [pressure] comes from the edge he’s able to step up and find an extra [second] worth of time to find a free receiver. ” And blitzing Brady a lot isn’t a good idea. “There isn’t a blitz I haven’t seen,” said Brady, a   NFL starting QB. The New York Giants beat him in a pair of Super Bowls (2007 and 2011) without blitzing. They relied on their front four to pressure him, allowing them to drop seven guys into coverage. “When you can affect him with a   rush, it’s absolutely pivotal for our defense,” said Falcons defensive tackle Tyson Jackson. “You can drop more in coverage. ” Plus, if you blitz, you aren’t likely to get there the Patriots allowed only 24 sacks in the regular season. Aside from Brady’s greatness, another problem for the Falcons  —   they are sans their top cornerback Desmond Trufant, on injured reserve. “[The Falcons] will lose, if their defense isn’t good enough,” said retired coach Dick Vermeil. It probably isn’t. The pick here is New England."
7866,7866,26602,Mattis to NATO: Pay More or U.S. Will ’Moderate Its Commitment’,Breitbart,Kristina Wong,2/15/17,2017,2,,"Defense Secretary James Mattis on Wednesday issued an ultimatum to NATO while meeting with member nations for the first time in Brussels: Pay more, or the U. S. will “moderate its commitment” to the organization. [“I owe it to you all to give you clarity on the political reality in the United States, and to state the fair demand from my country’s people in concrete terms,” he said during a   meeting, according to remarks provided to reporters traveling with him. “America will meet its responsibilities, but if your nations do not want to see America moderate its commitment to the alliance, each of your capitals needs to show its support for our common defense. ”  During his presidential campaign, President Donald Trump had repeatedly called on NATO members to pay more for their   in Europe. Only five of 28 member nations had met a requirement to spend at least two percent of their GDP on defense: the United States, the United Kingdom, Estonia, Poland, and Greece. NATO members France and Germany currently spend 1. 78 percent and 1. 19 percent respectively, according to the NATO figures. According to the Washington Post, Mattis recalled that when he was NATO’s supreme allied commander of transformation from November 2007 to September 2009,   Secretary Robert Gates warned NATO nations that America “would lose their patience for carrying a disproportionate burden” of the defense of allies. Mattis said that impatience is now a “governmental reality. ” “No longer can the American taxpayer carry a disproportionate share of the defense of Western values,” he added. “Americans cannot care more for your children’s security than you do. Disregard for military readiness demonstrates a lack of respect for ourselves, for the alliance and for the freedoms we inherited, which are now clearly threatened. ” The meeting comes ahead of a visit to NATO by Vice President Michael Pence on Monday. Before the   meeting, Mattis called NATO a “fundamental bedrock. ” “The alliance remains a fundamental bedrock for the United States and for all the   community,” he said. During his confirmation hearing, Mattis called the alliance “the most successful military alliance, probably in modern history, maybe ever. ” His first calls to foreign counterparts included NATO members, as well as NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. But he also said in responses provided to the Senate Armed Services Committee in advance of the hearing, “member states must share the burden of common defense, and meet or exceed the commitment to reach the two percent defense spending goal that their leaders set at the NATO summit in 2014. ”"

Keough told Breitbart Texas in an exclusive interview. “The people in the gallery were holding up signs saying they are in the country illegally, and Democrat state reps are cheering them on. ” “We all took the same oath to uphold and defend the Constitutions of Texas and the United States at the beginning of the session,” the Republican representative continued. “And here they were, encouraging lawless behavior. ” Keough told Breitbart Texas that House rules expressly prohibit this type of conduct. “Unfortunately, the House    and other security personnel were upstairs in the gallery dealing with the disruptive crowd,” he explained. “When the Speaker calls for order, you are supposed to settle down, but they just continued encouraging the crowd. I couldn’t believe it. ” The chants from protesters came after the House Speaker had ordered Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) troopers to clear the House Gallery of protesters who were attempting to disrupt the final day of the legislative session. Romero and other Democrat state representatives were seen by their Republican colleagues as egging on the protesters while law enforcement officers tried to maintain peace and order. State Representative Jonathan Stickland ( ) told Breitbart Texas that at this point when the video by Keough was filmed, several DPS troopers had been assaulted and pushed down the steps in the gallery by the crowd. “These troopers were trying to restore order, and Democrats were egging them on from the floor,” Stickland said. “I have never seen anything like this in the House. ” Rinaldi would later accuse Romero of physically assaulting him after he told Democrat reps he had called ICE on the protesters claiming to be illegal aliens. “When I told the Democrats I called ICE, Representative Ramon Romero physically assaulted me, and other Democrats were held back by colleagues,” Rinaldi posted on Facebook. This session has seen the passage of historic, but emotional legislation relating to prohibiting sanctuary cities in Texas. Senate Bill 4, authored by Senator Charles Perry ( ) is now the law of the state. The law which prohibits sheriff’s and police chiefs from ignoring immigration detainers and having policies forbidding officers from asking about immigration status becomes effective on September 1, 2017. The bill provides civil fines and even criminal penalties to law enforcement officials choosing to ignore immigration authorities. This new law was the focus of protesters on the final day of the session. The emotional debate over the bill left emotional scars on relationships between representatives with opposing viewpoints. In a few weeks, the legislature will reconvene in a special session called by Governor Greg Abbott on July 18.

7868,7868,26604,Exclusive: Source Says Megyn Kelly ‘Would Not Be Welcomed Back’ at Fox News,Breitbart,Tony Lee,6/20/17,2017,6,,"Controversy usually creates cash and big ratings —  except if you are NBC News’ Megyn Kelly. [After Kelly’s controversial and   interview with Alex Jones tanked by again failing to beat out reruns of 60 Minutes and America’s Funniest Home Videos, New York radio host Mark Simone tweeted on Monday that NBC is trying to unload Kelly and convince Fox News to take her back.  But a   Fox News source told Breitbart News that there is “no way” Kelly could come back to the network. Quite simply, the source told Breitbart News, Kelly “would not be welcomed back. ” Inside scoop:  NBC now trying to get rid of Megyn Kelly. Even trying to get FOX to buy out her contract and take her back.  —   MARK SIMONE (@MarkSimoneNY) June 19, 2017,  Simone also suggested that if Kelly becomes more toxic and her ratings tank even more, “NBC will have to take her off the network,” and “if they are stuck with her, they’ll give her an MSNBC show. ” NBC will have to take her off the network  —   if they are stuck with her, they’ll give her an MSNBC show,  —   MARK SIMONE (@MarkSimoneNY) June 19, 2017,  Before she bolted to NBC, Kelly anchored The Kelly File on Fox News. During the 2016 election cycle, Kelly won praise from mainstream media journalists when she tried to undercut Donald Trump during the first Republican presidential debate in August of 2015 in Cleveland, Ohio. She also gave “Never Trumpers” a forum on her primetime show to constantly slam Trump throughout the election cycle. And as the Daily Beast’s Lloyd Grove noted, Kelly also “hastened [Roger] Ailes’ forced resignation last July with her fateful decision to recount his misconduct to a team of lawyers hired by 21st Century Fox to investigate allegations made in the sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit filed by Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson. ” New York magazine’s Gabriel Sherman reported that Kelly “told investigators that Ailes made unwanted sexual advances toward her about ten years ago when she was a young correspondent at Fox. ” As Grove pointed out, Kelly, in her book, said there was some “poetic justice” in the role she played in helping boot Ailes out of Fox News. “I worked my tail off  …     I established myself as a serious person,” Kelly wrote. “I built my own power. And when the allegations against Roger hit, I used it. Perhaps there is some poetic justice in that. ” NBC reportedly invested nearly $20 million a year to bring Kelly to the network, and NBC’s investment has not paid any dividends at all. After her interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kelly was mocked for being way out of her league. And when HuffPost obtained the full unedited interview in which a “nervous” Kelly lobbed Putin “softballs,” Kelly was subjected to another round of criticism. Her interview with Jones did not have any news value and may have damaged NBC’s and her reputation more than it helped. Advertisers like J. P. Morgan Chase fled while Kelly lost credibility in the eyes of many when, in a leaked recording that Jones released, Kelly is heard telling Jones, “It’s not gonna be some gotcha hit piece, I promise you that. ” NBC did not help matters when it released a photo of Kelly and Jones that, as The Hill’s media columnist Joe Concha described, looked “like they were on a Tinder date pulling up to a  . ” Yet despite all of the hype, Kelly’s interview with Jones still flopped. 60 Minutes and America’s Funniest Home Videos reruns even beat Kelly’s show by nearly 40 percent in the coveted 18 to    demographic, as Concha noted. A television executive told CNN over the weekend that NBC’s “fundamental mistake” was thinking that Kelly was actually a “superstar. ” NBC executives have already reportedly determined that viewers are not going to tune in to Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly just to watch Kelly and are “freaking out” over the “ratings disaster” that is Kelly."

7870,7870,26606,Trump to ‘Clamp Down’ On Immigration Through ‘Merit-Based’ System,Breitbart,John Binder,1/20/17,2017,1,,"WASHINGTON, D. C.  —     Donald Trump’s first act as president will reportedly be to “clamp down” on the country’s immigration system and refugee resettlement program, while enforcing a “ ” method, focusing on skilled workers. [In a new piece by the LA Times, the   newspaper says Trump will immediately focus on the broken immigration system, both legal and illegal, just as his campaign for president promised:  Gone will be the temporary protections of the final Obama years for people in the country illegally. In their place, expect to see images on the evening news of workplace raids as Trump sends a message that he is wasting no time on his promised crackdown. The LA Times cites Trump spokesman Sean Spicer’s statement on immigration as an indication that the incoming administration will not take a backseat to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on the issue. “We need to get control of our borders and we need to get control of our immigration system, and we can do it in a very smart and methodical way that ensures that the priority is first and foremost people who seek to cause us harm or who are a danger in a community,” Spicer told the LA Times. The LA Times also noted Trump’s widespread powers as president over the country’s immigration system, writing that “Trump can act on immigration without Congress”: Taken together, the actions would result in a significant shift in how immigration law is enforced, which could itself create a ripple effect that alters the immigration pool and how the 11 million or so in the U. S. illegally live their lives. Unlike some of his other   plans, such as replacing Obamacare, Trump can act on immigration without Congress under the president’s wide legal authority to control borders. “We’re going to move very quickly on the border,” Vice   Mike Pence told NBC News on Wednesday, saying Trump could even use his executive power to start on his chief immigration pledge  —   building a wall along the border with Mexico. That   on immigration could come via a   immigration system, which would mean less   immigrants and more   workers to take jobs that cannot be filled from the country’s native population, POLITICO reported. “We’re going to have great people and people of great talent coming into our country,” Trump said in an interview with Fox  Friends. “And if you can think of this, some of the Silicon Valley companies want to build up in Canada, because in Canada, they’re able to get the people that they need and they can’t get them in this country because we don’t allow them in this country. ” “So we’re going to take care of a lot of situations,” Trump continued, referring the country’s immigration system. “And we’re going to have a lot of heart, believe me. It’s going to be a heart almost as big as yours. ” The   immigration plan could be trotted out by the incoming Trump administration “over the next two to three months,” as he noted in the interview. Immigration groups like NumbersUSA heralded the potential   system, saying that it would favor giving legal immigrant residence to individuals who fill jobs, rather than the current system which favors family members of immigrants already living in the U. S. John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder."

[From the Hollywood Reporter:  If Donald Trump gets his way on tax reform, Hollywood actors, directors, and writers stand to be among the biggest beneficiaries. Understanding why takes some appreciation of the fact that the entertainment industry isn’t just five big corporations, but also thousands of smaller ones  —   almost all incredibly obscure even if their owners are quite famous. As the tax code currently stands, the richest individuals pay almost 40 percent on individual income (or less after deductions). Businesses pay a separate rate, which Trump wishes to set at 15 percent. Most importantly, the proposal outlined by the Trump Administration has this latter rate being applied to all businesses, including “ ” organizations like S corporations that distribute a salary to   and count the rest as profits. Under the current law, personal income and business income is taxed roughly the same, but if Trump succeeds, many folks may aim to establish   for themselves to get their taxes down to 15 percent. Guess what? Many in Hollywood are largely set up already thanks to “ ” corporations that contract out services like acting and directing to production studios. Alas, alongside the 21st Century Fox’s and Time Warner’s come Kaling International (Mindy Kaling) Kimsaprincess Inc.

Dave Brat ( ) faced unending interruptions at a town hall meeting in Richmond on Tuesday night. [Before Brat could even speak, the crowd chanted “read our questions,” and repeatedly yelled out “you lie” as he tried to make his remarks.  “I’m trying to listen to the people on the key issues of our day” Brat yelled over the continuous heckling. “If we go this route it’s going to be very hard to have rational, civil discourse all night. ” “I’m trying my best here,” Brat said in a video of part of the town hall that was posted on YouTube. When Brat tried to explain how the American Health Care Act passed by the House last week would cover   conditions, people booed and tried to shout him down. Activists cheered when someone asked about Trump’s tax returns and about why the Congressional Budget Office had not scored the GOP health care bill before it was voted on. Brat said he agreed a score was needed, but he was still jeered by people in the audience, some dressed in   that read “RESIST” and others showing support for Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. The Associated Press reported the town hall this way: “Critics of Republican U. S. Rep. Dave Brat and the House health care bill he voted for packed a raucous town hall meeting in his Virginia district Tuesday night, booing and shouting down the congressman from start to finish. Brat is the latest in a series of lawmakers across the country who have gotten an earful from constituents at town hall meetings since last week’s passage of the House health care bill that would repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. ” “Hundreds of people packed the suburban Richmond church for the meeting Brat   with a Republican state senator, and dozens of protesters lined up outside ahead of its start, many of them holding signs shaped like tombstones. Inside, opponents appeared to far outnumber supporters. ” Much of the town hall focused on the American Health Care Act, which passed last week on a   vote in the House, with Brat voting for it. But Brat, like other members of the Freedom Caucus, opposed the first version of the act and only came on board this round after the   amendment was added to allow states to obtain a waiver to avoid some Affordable Care Act regulations. Brat was also asked about Trump firing FBI Director James Comey and whether he would push for a special prosecutor to investigate any ties the president might have with Russia. Brat said he would not and added, “In this country you are innocent until there’s evidence. “And this applies to all of you, right?” Brat said. “No one wants the federal government coming after you unless there is evidence and no one can stand up and give me the evidence. ” "
7875,7875,26611,DNI: Insiders Leaking ’Classified’ Information ’a Significant Threat’ Under Trump - Breitbart,Breitbart,Edwin Mora,5/15/17,2017,5,,"WASHINGTON, DC  —   The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) has warned that deliberate leaks of “sensitive or classified” U. S. government information by “trusted insiders” will “remain a significant threat” during President Donald Trump’s tenure. [DNI Daniel Coats’ warning can be found in the latest World Wide Threat Assessment unveiled during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing last week.  “Trusted insiders who disclose sensitive or classified US Government information without authorization will remain a significant threat in 2017 and beyond,” notes the assessment, authored by the U. S. intelligence community. “The sophistication and availability of information technology that increases the scope and impact of unauthorized disclosures exacerbate this threat. ” What Coats describes sounds similar to what has come to be known as the “deep state,” which refers to entities within and outside the federal government colluding to prevent a democratically elected leader from implementing his agenda. Breitbart News reported: The term “deep state” has been used to refer to deliberate leaks designed to undermine the president, but also to the willing collusion of elements of the mainstream media, the latent distrust and suspected opposition of elements of the intelligence services, but also the willing resistance of certain career civil servants in the agencies charged with carrying President Trump’s directions to fruition. Specifically, the primary purpose of the “deep state is to undermine a democratically elected leader’s agenda and ultimately overthrow that leader. A “deep state” is primarily powered by a steady drip of classified information, much like what has been taking place under the Trump administration. Nevertheless, various mainstream media outlets have dismissed the existence of an American “deep state” working against the Trump administration as a conspiracy theory. The “deep state” involves an intricate network comprised of government insiders, often made up of individuals from the military and intelligence communities. Many media outlets described concerns voiced by President Trump and his supporters about the intelligence community and other components of the government leaking classified information as paranoia. Through the threat assessment, the intelligence community itself is warning that the disclosure of classified information by “trusted” government insiders is not only real but also poses a “significant threat. ” The Worldwide Threat Assessment also warns against foreign actors, including some from Latin America, seeking to infiltrate the U. S. government. It reports: The United States will face a complex global foreign Intelligence threat environment in 2017. We assess that the leading state intelligence threats to US interests will continue to be Russia and China, based on their services’ capabilities, intent, and broad operational scope. Other states in South Asia, the Near East, East Asia, and Latin America will pose local and regional Intelligence threats to US interests. For example, Iranian and Cuban intelligence and security services continue to view the United States as a primary threat. Penetrating the US national decision making apparatus and the Intelligence Community will remain primary objectives for numerous foreign intelligence entities. Additionally, the targeting of national security information and proprietary information from US companies and research institutions involved with defense, energy, finance,   technology, and other areas will remain a persistent threat to US interests. Besides foreign governments like Russia and China,   criminals will also seek to undermine America’s intelligence community by recruiting American government insiders to obtain information and conduct surveillance. “  entities, including international terrorists and transnational organized crime groups, are likely to continue to employ and improve their intelligence capabilities including by human, technical, and cyber means. As with state intelligence services, these   entities recruit sources and perform physical and technical surveillance to facilitate their illicit activities and avoid detection and capture,” points out the threat assessment. In 2016, the threat assessment also warned that “insiders who disclose sensitive US Government information without authorization will remain a significant threat in 2016. ”"

[Polish community leaders claimed the aspects of Britain that migrants like best, its “culture of tolerance” and “diversity” have been shattered since the Brexit vote because people have been emboldened to carry out verbal and physical attacks against migrants.  “Every statement and every political activity around Brexit negotiations brings a spike in inquiries to our organisation. We expect when article 50 is triggered it will bring another level of discontent,” Barbara Drozdowicz, of the East European Resource Centre (EERC) told the Commons Home Affairs Committee. Ms. Drozdowicz fingered criticism of mass migration as a driver of ‘hate’ in response to a question by fierce Remain campaigner Chuka Umunna. The Labour MP pointed to “Leave. EU, UKIP obviously” when he asked the EERC director whether she believes the “Leave campaign” and   figures “bear a responsibility” for   attacks. “The campaign was built on controlling migration. ‘Controlling migration’ is not a neutral term,” she told MPs. When Conservative David Burrowes noted that most examples of ‘hate’ are expressed online, community leaders admitted they’ve neither seen nor had reports of content on the internet that’s abusive to migrants from Europe. Tadeusz Stenzel, the chair of trustees at the Federation of Poles in Great Britain, suggested there might be a language barrier which prevents European migrants from being able to understand abusive posts and report them. MPs heard that European migrants began reporting ‘hate crimes’ in around April of last year as the referendum campaign got into gear, but that only after Britons voted to leave the European Union (EU) was the resource centre inundated with an “explosion of calls”. Ms. Drozdowicz said migrants from Eastern Europe reported being told to “go home” and hearing ‘casual hate speech’ on public transport and that the centre heard about violent incidents including a Polish child being beaten up at school. Chairman of the committee, Yvette Cooper, said the details of incidents that were talked about in the session were “appalling”. “Hate crime is appalling,   and should have no place in our country,” she said. Heading the government’s inquiry into ‘hate crime’ in November, Ms. Cooper accused the campaigns of both Leave, during the EU referendum, and Donald Trump, in the U. S. presidential race, of having incited hatred."

[“The trend is clear, the number of applications we’ve received for gun licenses has more than doubled in five years” said Divisional Commissioner of the province of Liège, Thierry Brasseur.  The number of applications has steadily risen each year, jumping 117 per cent from 2010, when 608 permits were requested, to 1, 318 in 2015, Explaining that the trend looks set to continue, the commissioner revealed that the province received 1, 436 new applications in the last year, to December. Liège’s Service of Arms, the state body in charge of granting gun licenses in the province, hinted that rising crime, and terror attacks in Europe are what’s fueling the “extraordinary enthusiasm” with which Belgians are lining up to buy firearms. Speaking at a recent symposium, the department noted that “The explanation may lie in the current security context, which generates feelings of insecurity among the population” the department told a recent symposium. Another major contributor to Belgians’ anxiety, Le Soir reports, is the frequency which which burglaries and home invasions are taking place  —   180 a day in 2015, in the country of less than 11. 5 million people. Firearms permits are tightly controlled in Belgium, where they are only issued after the authorities conduct a “morality investigation” into applicants, who also have to pass a theoretical and practical test. Strict rules are in place for gun owners, too, as it’s forbidden to leave the house with a firearm unless it’s carried from there the the shooting club in a locked case. At home, the law states that guns must also be kept in a safe. At the symposium in Liège, participants were informed that soaring gun ownership has had no impact on crime, which has remained stable since 2015. “The problem is not people who have declared weapons and who are legally entitled to hold them. The real problem is the others” said Christophe Baes, the district commissioner of Walloon Brabant where gun permit requests jumped 20 per cent from 2015 to 2016. Following a series of tough gun control measures, affiliation to a sports shooting club has become the least complicated legal way to apply for a license. In Liège, 80 to 90 per cent of the new requests concern sports shooting. A similar trend can be seen in France, where shooting clubs have welcomed an additional 50, 000 licensees since 2011 according to a survey by L’Obs  —   an increase of almost 40 per cent  —   which has been reinforced a spate of terror attacks in the country. “Before the beginning of 2015, it was only a vague trend. Since the ‘Charlie Hebdo’ Bataclan and Nice attacks [gun license requests] have become a growing phenomenon. In the climate of psychosis that crosses the country, where there are real threats of terrorism, multiple insecurities and sometimes fantasies of all kinds, several indicators show that an increasing number of French people are seeking to arm themselves” France’s biggest news and information weekly noted. In the wake of mass sex attacks by migrant mobs in Cologne on New Year’s Eve 2016, major German cities all reported an influx of requests for weapons permits. Cologne police estimated that they received at least 304 applications within just two weeks of the mass sexual assaults. In 2015 the city’s police force saw just 408 applications total over the entire year."

[Jacob Ewing is accused of replicating scenes from seven porn videos he watched when he allegedly raped two women. A judge ruled that the videos are permitted to be used as evidence in his trial, the Kansas City Star reported.  “Apparently, portions of the videos depict acts that [Ewing] is said to have replicated himself upon the witnesses,” Jackson County District Judge Norbert Marek wrote in his ruling. “The relevance of this evidence could prove motive, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge or identity. ” Ewing “chose video after video” of women being raped or assaulted, which investigators say they discovered when they looked through his online browsing history, prosecutor Jacqie Spradling wrote in court documents. Ewing allegedly raped one woman in September 2014 and another in May 2016. Court papers describe how Ewing watched the violent porn videos within 45 days of the second rape he allegedly committed. Spradling filed a motion that said there is evidence that Ewing watched four hours of violent porn a day on average, including scenes where women were strangled and forced to eat vomit, the Topeka   reported. Ewing’s attorney said the footage is “highly, highly prejudicial” against her client and argued that the footage should not be used as evidence. Ewing faces multiple charges, including rape, aggravated sodomy, and battery. Marek previously declined a motion for similar evidence to be used against Ewing in a trial last month, where Ewing was acquitted of a separate case involving the sexual assault of a    girl. Ewing faces multiple trials for separate sexual assault cases scheduled in June, August, and October. He remains in jail but pleaded not guilty to each of the charges against him."

[On Saturday, former President Obama’s spokesman Kevin Lewis denied that the former White House or the former President himself would have given such an order to wiretap Trump Tower —  or any other type of surveillance in any case —  but that such an order would have come from an “independent investigation led by the Department of Justice. ”  “A cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice,” Lewis said. “As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U. S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false. ” Lewis’ statement on the former president’s behalf came in response to the explosive charges from President Donald Trump, who tweeted on Saturday morning that the Obama team conducted surveillance on Trump Tower during the campaign and afterward. Valerie Jarrett, another close Obama aide, also tweeted the statement from former President Obama’s spokesman, Lewis. Jarrett is, according to the U. K.

What’s more, Philip Rucker, the White House bureau chief at the Washington Post, says the same thing as these former Obama officials: That the Obama spokesman’s statement does not deny the existence of wiretaps on Trump Tower, only that Obama himself and the Obama White House did not approve them if they did exist. The Obama statement does not say there was no federal wire tapping of Trump Tower. It only says Obama and White House didn’t order it.  —   Philip Rucker (@PhilipRucker) March 4, 2017,  The outrage from the media and the Democrats appears to be standard hatred of Trump. The president forced a set of facts into the news cycle that was already previously public but framed in a way that puts his political opponents and the establishment media on the defensive. This appears to be the calculus: either the wiretaps exist, as Trump suggests, and the president will use them to bludgeon the Obama administration and the media for impropriety and overreach or, there were no wiretaps, which suggests the previous administration had no reason to suspect Trump colluded with a foreign government."

[Hamas’ deputy diplomatic leader Mousa Abu Marzouk and former Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh met with Egyptian military officials this week.  “Extraditing jihadists to Egypt would send significant shockwaves across the Gaza Strip and will create a backlash among Hamas loyalists, most notably its military wing operatives,” a Hamas official told Breitbart Jerusalem. He said the fate of the jihadists detained by Hamas was a central part of the negotiation between the two parties and the main impediment to progress in an overall positive process of rapprochement with Egypt. “Haniyeh and Marzouk gave all the information they had about Islamic State loyalists in the Gaza Strip, including some specific names that the Egyptians raised,” he said. “They also pledged that they’ll pass on any information their interrogation may yield. But extradition remains a bone of contention. ” He said that security arrangements across the border to prevent the movement of militants between Sinai and Gaza have been discussed, as well as the establishment of a joint force. He failed to disclose any further details about this. Meanwhile, Hamas has continued to loosen its grip on IS sympathizers in Gaza. A Gaza jihadi affiliated with IS ideology said that for the first time in almost a year Hamas has allowed detainees to be visited by their families. Abu Baker Almuhajer surmised that Hamas is hoping to persuade Welayat Sinai, IS’s Egyptian affiliate, to send a weapons shipment it has delayed. Speaking to Egyptian journalists in Cairo, Marzouk said that Hamas “turned over a new leaf with Egypt, and no longer shelters anyone who may be a risk to Egypt’s national security. ” He said Hamas’ relationship with Egypt was better than it had ever been, and that the Egyptian judiciary had failed to link Hamas to attacks against Egyptian targets. “Currently, there are no more outstanding issues between us and our Egyptian brothers,” he said. “We received from them a wanted list, comprising very few names, and we’ll discuss each of them individually. ”"

Ellison is a leading candidate to become chairman of the Democratic National Committee, who will be chosen by a party vote in late February. He has public support from the Democrats’ leader in the Senate. Sen. Chuck Schumer, but faces growing opposition from former labor secretary Tom Perez. The press conference was called to protest President Donald Trump’s popular policy to curb immigration of people with “hostile attitudes. ” Both Ellison and Awad insisted the hostile attitudes policy is   even though it only seeks to exclude people who: do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law   …     those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including “honor” killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation.

One is a very good idea, and one is a terrible idea. The idea of being physically safe on campus, not being subjected to sexual harassment and physical abuse, or something like that. Being targeted specifically  …    Hey, I’m perfectly fine with that,” Jones claimed. “But there is another view that is now, I think, ascendent  …     It’s a horrible view, which is that ‘I need to be safe ideologically, I need to be safe emotionally, I just need to feel good all the time. And if someone else says something that I don’t like that is a problem for everyone else including the administration,” he continued. Jones suggested that safe spaces from ideas contradict the purpose of a university education: “I think that’s a terrible idea for the following reason: I don’t want you to be safe ideologically. I don’t want you to be safe emotionally. I want you to be strong. That’s different. I’m not going to pave the jungle for you. Put on some boots and learn how to deal with adversity.

7885,7885,26621,Christians in 2017 ’Most Persecuted Group in the World’,Breitbart,"Thomas D. Williams, Ph.D.",4/16/17,2017,4,,"In many parts of the world, Christians gathering to celebrate Christ’s resurrection do so with the knowledge that any day their faith could cost them their lives as it has for thousands of their brothers and sisters. [On Palm Sunday, twin bombings by jihadists at two Egyptian churches killed at least 45 worshippers and wounded more than 100 others in the latest of a long string of deadly attacks targeting Christians throughout the world.  The attacks were directed specifically to Christian in their houses of worship to avoid any ambiguity regarding the intent. As has been noted, this was “an attack on Christians simply because they are Christians. ” On Saturday, the Pakistan military said it has thwarted a “major terrorist attack” against Christians planned for Easter Sunday after a successful overnight raid just hours after Christians celebrated Good Friday services. On Easter Sunday 2016, an Islamist militant took the lives of more than 70 people and injured over 320 more after detonating his suicide vest in a park in Lahore that was full of Christian families celebrating the feast. Among the victims are more than 30 small children, who at the time of the blast were playing sports and outdoor games in the    Park. During the last calendar year, some 90, 000 Christians were killed for their faith across the globe, making Christians by far the most persecuted group in the world, according to a study from the   Center for Studies on New Religions (CESNUR). The director of CESNUR, Dr. Massimo Introvigne, told Breitbart News that whereas atheistic communist regimes were the greatest persecutors of Christians in the last century, “Islamic  ” has taken its place as the   agent of persecution. The Center’s findings corroborate those of other scholars and human rights groups. According to the 2016 “World Watch List,” for example, published by the Open Doors organization, nine out of the top ten countries where Christians suffer “extreme persecution” had populations that are at least 50 percent Muslim. Their 2016 report revealed that “Islamic extremism is by far the most significant persecution engine” of Christians in the world today and that “40 of the 50 countries on the World Watch List are affected by this kind of persecution. ” During the year, nearly   of the Christians killed for their faith were executed at the hands of Islamic extremists such as the Islamic State or Boko Haram. While tens of thousands of Christians are killed for their faith, Introvigne said, they are just the tip of the iceberg and much persecution takes place on a daily basis that never makes news. Along with the enormous number of deaths, a great many more Christians —  as many as 600 million —  were prevented from practicing their faith in 2016. On Easter 2015, Pope Francis reminded the world that there are more Christian martyrs in the present age than even in the first centuries, when the Roman Empire attempted to eliminate all followers of the nascent religion. Calling for “tangible help in the defense and protection of our brothers and sisters who are persecuted, exiled, killed, and beheaded just for being Christians,” Francis told a crowd of tens of thousands in St. Peter’s Square that today’s martyrs “are more numerous than in the first centuries. ” Follow Thomas D.

[The name “Knock, Knock” is derived from the tactic the gangs use to burglarize the homes. They reportedly form small groups of three or four, one of whom knocks on the front door of the home. If no one answers  —   giving the impression that no one is home  —   the gang member who knocked on the door signals the others and they seek entry through doors and windows around the home.  According to the   Daily News, the home of the Los Angeles Lakers’ Nick Young was targeted on “February 18 or 19,” with thieves taking cash and other valuables worth approximately $500, 000. Former Lakers player Derek Fisher was also targeted, with thieves taking cash, jewelry and other goods worth approximately $300, 000 from his Tarzana home. KTLA reported that the burglary of Young’s home occurred “the same weekend the NBA was hosting its   Game festivities in New Orleans. ” Young was in New Orleans for the event, competing in the contest for   shooting. No one was home when the “knock, knock” burglars struck. The homes of singers Alanis Morisette and Nicki Minaj were also hit. The New York Daily News reports that Minaj’s home was “robbed of approximately $200, 000 worth of items. ” Suspects also destroyed property in Minaj’s home and cut up some of her clothes.

7890,7890,26626,’The Most Trusted National Leader Today’: 80 Percent of Filipinos Have ’Much Trust’ in Duterte,Breitbart,Frances Martel,5/8/17,2017,5,,"A national poll released Monday showed Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s popularity holding steady, with 80 percent of respondents saying they have “much trust” in the controversial strongman. [The Social Weather Stations (SWS) polling occurs after every annual quarter, this poll taken between March 25 to 28 but published Monday. The SWS poll found that ten percent of the 1, 200 respondents had “little” trust in Duterte, and another nearly 11 percent were undecided. Reuters notes that this represents a   drop from his   “much trust” approval rating in December 2016. Throughout the entirety of SWS’s tracking of Duterte  —   since December 2015  —   Duterte has remained near the   mark, with his highest rating at 84 percent after his election but before his inauguration. Reuters adds that Duterte’s initial trust rating in December 2015 was at 47 percent.  Duterte’s ratings are better with men than women, as 83 percent of men and 79 percent of women say they had “much trust” in the president, gaining one percentage point among men and one among women. Regionally, his best ratings came from his native Mindanao, a southern Philippine island, where 90 percent of respondents said they had “much trust” in Duterte, down from 92 percent in December. The Philippine Star notes that the presidential palace announced the numbers with pride, as SWS deems an 80 percent “much trust” percentage as an “excellent” approval rating. “The President continues to be the most trusted national leader today,” presidential spokesman Ernesto Arbella told reporters. “His net trust rating has been excellent for four consecutive quarters, considering the deeply entrenched culture of illegal drugs, criminality and corruption. ” Duterte’s enduring popularity appears unaffected by a global campaign to raise awareness about his call for extrajudicial killings against drug suspects. Duterte, who won the presidency on a campaign to eradicate drug crime calling upon his   tenure as the mayor of Davao City, where he enacted sprawling   initiatives. Duterte has encouraged civilians to kill suspected drug criminals and offered them bounties. He also claimed to have killed suspects himself as mayor. In December, SWS found that his policies against drugs were largely popular. While 80 percent of respondents said they personally feared being killed as part of Duterte’s drug war, 85 percent said they approved of Duterte’s approach to solving the problem.   a regional broadcast outlet, quotes experts stating that Duterte’s popularity is largely the product of his populist,   image. “He comes across very strongly as ‘makamasa’ and it’s not only giving an impression, he packs that with good action,” Fr. Ranhilio Aquino, dean of the San Beda Graduate School of Law, told the outlet. “Makamasa” is a Tagalog term roughly meaning “man of the people. ” Duterte refuses to live in the presidential palace, Malacanang, in Manila, for fear of it being haunted by late presidents. Instead, he lives in his humble Mindanao home while he is not in the capital. In January, Duterte hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at his home instead of Malacanang, offering him a traditional breakfast and his favorite mosquito net. The positive ratings for Duterte arrive as he embarks on a foreign policy venture around Asia. The presidential palace announced that Duterte will leave the country on May 10 to visit Cambodia, Hong Kong, and China. Among the items on Duterte’s agenda is a meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) where an estimated 700 “leaders from business, government, and civil society groups” will convene. Duterte’s visit to China also arrives following what appears to be a shift in policy from the Philippine president, who once boasted of seeking to sever ties with the United States to get closer to Beijing but has since offered President Donald Trump “full friendship and cooperation. ” Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."

[Conway appeared on CNN’s Anderson Cooper 360 on December 30 and noted that accusations that Russia hacked the 2016 election are rising to a “fever pitch” since Donald J. Trump won the White House.

Kellyanne Conway wonders if Russian sanctions were intended to restrict Trump https:  .  https:  .   —   Anderson Cooper 360° (@AC360) December 30, 2016,  “Even those who are sympathetic to President Obama on most issues are saying that part of the reason he did this today was to quote, ‘box in’   Trump,” Conway said. Conway did not outright accuse the President of acting in bad faith. “I was quoting David Sanger’s piece in The New York Times,” Conway insisted. “I am merely saying that if The New York Times’ report is true and credible, that that would be very unfortunate if politics were the motivating factor here, but we can’t help but think that that’s often true. ” The incoming President’s adviser also pointed out that Trump is “not in favor of foreign governments interfering in our elections or interfering in our intelligence, but we’re also not in favor of our intelligence interfering with elections after the fact. ” Earlier that Friday, President Obama took the unusual action of ejecting dozens of Russian diplomats from the country as he ramped up his response to his charge that Russian hackers interfered in the November elections. Despite Obama’s constant claim, however, no actual proof has been forthcoming that Russia hacked our elections. In response to Obama’s ouster of 35 Russian officials, Russian strongman Vladimir Putin dismissed Obama’s actions and did not retaliate in kind as he has in the past. “Reserving the right to retaliate, we will not resort to the level of irresponsible ‘kitchen’ diplomacy,” Putin said in a Friday statement, calling it “regrettable” that Obama was choosing to end his administration with such a provocative action.

S. under the Wet   Foot policy has turned into a nightmare after hundreds of Cubans have been left stranded at the   border. The islanders have a   permit from the Mexican government to travel north that leaves them subject to deportation thereafter. [More than 50 Cubans currently stuck in this border city are left only to hope that   Donald Trump shortly reverses the recent decision imposed by President Barack Obama that ended the   naturalization process for Cuban refugees. Some of the Cubans who spoke with Breitbart Texas expressed their surprise and disappointment upon learning that U. S. authorities would not let them enter the country legally.   “A new president that wants to help the oppressed people of Cuba is our only hope,” said Carlos Martin, a stranded Cuban refugee. “We have nothing and we can not go back it was a very radical decision. ”  Similar to the situation in Nuevo Laredo, in the border state of Nuevo León local authorities are preparing for hundreds of Cuban families to arrive with underage children as they attempt to reach Tamaulipas and eventually pass to Texas before their permits expire. The   permits are given to the Cubans by Mexico’s National Immigration Institute, granting them a temporary stay in the country after which they must leave the country. The permit has generally been used by migrants from a variety of nations to make their way to a northern border checkpoint.  “Many here think that the new Trump government will open the doors to the Cubans who arrive at the international bridges,” a Mexican immigration agent from Nuevo León told Breitbart Texas, “For them this is their only option, they don’t have money and they can’t return to Cuba. ”  As Breitbart Texas reported, the new immigration policy by Obama paints a target on the Cubans who will likely be sought by criminal organizations or law enforcement once their permit expires.

Because we didn’t tell the voters we were going to repeal Obamacare, but keep some of the Obamacare taxes. We didn’t tell the voters we’re going to repeal Obamacare, but keep and extend Medicaid expansion. And we certainly didn’t tell the voters we’re going to repeal Obamacare, but start a new entitlement. ”  Jordan said, “[L]et’s do this right, and, more importantly, let’s do what we told the voters we’re going to do. That’s why today I’ll be introducing legislation which just says clean repeal. Let’s vote on the exact same thing, 15 months ago, every single Republican in the House, every single Republican in the Senate voted on. We put it on President Obama’s desk. Of course, he vetoed it. But let’s put that same legislation on President Trump’s desk, and then work on the replacement model that will actually bring down the cost of insurance. I don’t think the plan they introduced yesterday is going to bring down the cost for working class and middle class families. ” He stated of the current replacement, “Every conservative group out there is opposed to this legislation, because, as I said yesterday and others have said, I think it’s Obamacare in a different form. Because we didn’t tell the voters we were going to repeal Obamacare, but keep some of the Obamacare taxes. We didn’t tell the voters we’re going to repeal Obamacare, but keep and extend Medicaid expansion. And we certainly didn’t tell the voters we’re going to repeal Obamacare, but start a new entitlement. ” He further said that he doesn’t think the current replacement “could pass today.   …     So, this needs to be changed in a dramatic way for it to have a chance to pass, in my judgment. ” Jordan continued his criticism of the current replacement, arguing, “[T]his is what Americans hate. We campaign on one thing, and then we get here and say, oh, we can’t do what we campaigned on. We really can’t do a clean repeal, and then replace it with something that’s going to bring down the costs. We’ve got to mush it all together and do some different form of Obamacare. That’s what the American voters hate. Let’s do what we told them we were going to do. Let’s do what they sent us here to do and what they expect us to do. ” Jordan also stated, “Even if you don’t have the CBO score, look at the four corners of the document and read what it says. I think it’s not going to bring down the cost of premiums for working class and middle class families. That’s why I oppose it. I think it’s Obamacare, as I’ve said, Obamacare in a different form. That’s why I oppose it. But it would also be nice to have a score. I can’t believe the score won’t be high because, when you’re extending and expanding the Medicaid expansion, when you’re starting this new entitlement called advanceable refundable tax credits, when you’re doing all that, I’ve got to believe that’s a cost to the federal government. But apart from that, just look at what it does, it keeps the federal government in control of how this thing works, the exchange and that sort of thing. That’s the wrong approach because we’ve seen how bad Obamacare has been for the American people the last six years. ” Jordan added his replacement plan “would put in place policies that will bring back affordable insurance. That’s the big problem right now. If people can afford the premiums, they can’t afford the deductibles. Fewer choices, higher costs is what Obamacare has given us. We want those policies, like expanded health savings accounts, interstate shopping, easier formation of association health plans, tax deductibility on the individual market side so that you begin to equalize treatment for folks who get their insurance in the individual market with those who get   plan insurance. So, that’s what we want to do. Those kinds of things will bring down the cost. And most importantly, you get out all the regulations which drove up the cost of insurance. Never forget what Obamacare did. It set mandates, taxes, and regulations, drove up the cost of insurance, told every American, you have to buy it, and if you don’t, there’s a penalty. That’s what we have to get away from. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"

[Early Thursday morning, a security detail transported a Mexican businessman, his wife and a group of other men to a local bar when unknown gunmen suddenly attacked. The gunmen began to rain gunfire on their victims, information released to Breitbart Texas by the Nuevo Leon government revealed.   The shooting took place in the Centrito Valle entertainment district of the upscale San Pedro neighborhood. The brief shooting killed three of the men and injured one of the bodyguards right outside a bar called La Unica.  Nuevo Leon public safety officials identified the three murder victims as    Jose Herrera Aispuro from the Mexican state of Sinaloa,    Michael Raciel Almela Martinez from Mexico State, and Carlos Sanchez Pliego Mier from the State of Queretaro. In the case of Sanchez Pliego authorities could not determine his exact age since the man appears to have various sets of identification documents indicating various ages.  At the crime scene, investigators noted that Herrera Aispuro wore a Rolex and had a large amount of Mexican currency in his possession. Mexican investigators revealed to Breitbart Texas that Herrera Aispuro is believed to have been an attorney working for operatives of the Beltran Leyva Cartel.  As Breitbart Texas has reported, Centrito Valle has been an area under the control of Beltran Leyva operatives who hold a monopoly over the street level drug distribution in the upscale sector. Breitbart Texas confirmed that last week, an accountant for the Beltran Leyva was also gunned down in Monterrey pointing to an apparent escalation of violence between rival cartels over the drug territories in Nuevo Leon.

Wimbledon is the oldest and most famous tennis tournament in the world, attracting 493, 928 spectators over 14 days in 2016, and   police are now investigating Mr. Butt’s motives for trying to work at the iconic event, The Sunday Telegraph reports. “The security firm would check his background but it does not have access to the police watch list or have knowledge of any MI5 investigation. There would have been no reason for him not to get the job,” a security source told the paper. They added: “Butt could not only have caused serious damage but potentially helped other terrorists get into one of these events. ” The revelation comes as Scotland Yard released photographs of the three London Bridge attackers’ fake suicide belts Sunday night. Mr. Butt was a supporter of notorious hate preacher Anjem Choudary’s banned terror group   and appeared on a Channel 4 television documentary called The Jihadi Next Door in 2016. He was reported to police for radicalising children in a park and was followed around the clock in 2015 whilst intelligence services were intercepting his communications under a warrant signed by the home secretary. Officers wound down the investigation, however, amidst concerns that there was not enough evidence to convict the suspect and “get him off the streets” sources told The Sunday Times. The security insider continued: “We knew Butt was up to no good. We got to know him intimately. We wanted to get him off the streets. But the view was that we may not have enough to convict. ” The   British citizen, who came to the UK as an asylum seeker, was considered by police to be “low priority” despite warnings from whistleblowers.

[Journal reporters Shane Harris and Carol E. Lee cite “current and former officials” who say that “U. S. intelligence officials have withheld sensitive intelligence from President Donald Trump because they are concerned it could be leaked or compromised. ”  The intelligence officials who are withholding the information are doing so because they fear that Trump could leak secrets to Russia, or because of political battles with the president, according to the anonymous sources cited in the Journal report. While the White House told the Journal that it does not believe agencies are withholding information, theoretically there would be no way for White House officials to know. The Office of Director of National Intelligence also disputed the claims. But if the report is true, it would compound growing suspicions that intelligence agencies are leaking classified information illegally to media outlets to damage and confuse the Trump administration. On Wednesday, former CIA officer and 2016 presidential candidate Evan McMullin declared on CNN and Twitter that it was right for intelligence officials to leak illegally, because they had sworn an oath to protect the Constitution and the country. He described the president as a “security threat. ” The unfolding crisis is the most serious challenge to the Trump administration, still in its infancy.

[The police union “Alliance” have made it clear that they want officers in their union not to vote for Marine Le Pen on their website saying they want to, “block the candidate who challenges social democracy. ” The National Union of Independent Trade Unions have proclaimed the same message but many police say they will vote for Le Pen because they feel she can restore order to the streets of France plagued by violence and terrorism L’Express reports.  One of these officers is    Lucas who said that he had initially voted for the   candidate   Melenchon in the first round. Explaining why he will be voting for Le Pen he said, “I want things to change,” and didn’t believe that Macron’s policies were any different from the mainstream parties. Lucas said that he didn’t fully agree with Le Pen’s stance on migration, but her policies regarding law and order spoke to him as a police officer. At the moment, he said, “the rights of those held in police custody are more taken into account than those of the victims. ” Arnaud, an officer in Savoy, agreed with Lucas saying, “if the policemen vote Le Pen it is mainly for the security policies. I vote FN by default because there are no candidates who match me. ” The    also had choice words for Le Pen’s globalist rival Emmanuel Macron saying he was, “haughty and typically corresponds to the Parisian city dweller. ” Arnaud noted that it was not just in Paris where terror attacks have occurred and he is afraid Macron will reduce the number of officers in the future. “When one knows the realities of the ground,” voting for Le Pen is the logical choice said    Pierre who has been a Front National supporter for 30 years. “Security has to be a priority, everything stems from that,” he said. The officers are also supported by the majority of the armed police, known as the Gendarmerie, as a poll showed 51 percent supporting Le Pen in the first round and likely more in the second. Police are often on the receiving end of violence from   extremists as was the case earlier this week when several officers were injured during an   Pen march after extremists threw firebombs at them. Police are also targets for radical Islamic extremists and Islamic state terrorist fighters.

McCain’s vote came as a surprise to Senate leadership. McCain said he voted against the bill because he fears that it would prevent the BLM from writing improved regulation in the future. “While I am concerned that the BLM rule may be onerous, passage of the resolution would have prevented the federal government, under any administration, from issuing a rule that is ‘similar,’ according to the plain reading of the Congressional Review Act,” McCain said in a statement. McCain added, “I believe that the public interest is best served if the Interior Department issues a new rule to revise and improve the BLM methane rule. ” The bill marks the first time Republicans failed to pass a Congressional Review Act (CRA) bill to repeal an Obama administration rule since President Donald Trump took office. Critics of the   rule argue that it adds unnecessary costs to oil and natural gas drilling in federal lands. Senator John Barrasso ( ) told reporters, “This was a very duplicative, unnecessary act of government interference in an area where BLM had no authority. ” Barrasso said that he will ask Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to repeal the rule instead of attempting to repeal the rule again in the Senate. “It was   by the Obama administration, and we tried to remove it with the Congressional Review Act. That fell one vote short today, and as a result we’ll call on the secretary to withdraw it. ” Secretary Zinke told Sen. Bob Portman ( ) that no matter the result for the CRA bill, the BLM will take action to reduce methane pollution. Erik Milito, an executive at the American Petroleum Institute, lamented: While it is disappointing that the Senate did not act to correct the rule more quickly, we look forward to working with the administration on policies that continue our commitment to safely produce the energy that Americans rely on, help consumers, create jobs, strengthen our national security, and protect our environment. American Energy Alliance President Thomas Pyle issued a statement condemning the Senate’s inability to repeal the methane rule. He said: The Senate just squandered an opportunity to protect American workers and families from a regulation aimed at making energy more expensive. The evidence against this regulation is overwhelming. Not only does this regulation fall outside of the BLM’s jurisdiction, but the energy sector is already significantly reducing methane emissions without this   directive from the federal government. The cost of complying with this regulation will ultimately fall on the shoulders of the American people. Fortunately, the fight isn’t over. It’s now up to the Trump administration to do what the Senate failed to do and protect the American people from this unnecessary and costly regulation. Despite the setback in the Senate, the Interior Department will attempt to repeal the rule through administrative action. Kate McGregor, the Interior Department’s acting secretary for land and minerals, said, regarding the methane rule, that the agency will “suspend, revise or rescind given its significant regulatory burden that encumbers American energy production, economic growth and job creation. ” The agency did not signal which option it might choose. McGregor cited Trump’s executive order asking agencies to repeal or change rules that damage domestic energy production. The Interior secretary added, “The rule is expected to have real and harmful impacts on onshore energy development and could impact state and local jobs and revenue. Small independent oil and gas producers in states like North Dakota, Colorado and New Mexico, which account for a substantial portion of our nation’s energy wealth, could be hit the hardest. ”"
7907,7907,26643,New York City Schools Dump Kellogg’s Cereals for Healthier Breakfast Alternative - Breitbart,Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,3/5/17,2017,3,,"The New York City public school system has stopped serving a Kellogg’s brand cereal to students, replacing it with a healthier, organic brand of cereal made by a small California company. [Last year the Kellogg Company discontinued several flavors of its Kashi brand cereal, a product advertised as a healthier cereal choice. But instead of simply picking some of Kellogg’s other brands to replace Kashi, school officials decided to hold taste testing for other, newer brands. Ultimately the district chose the Back to the Roots brand, The New York Times reported.  The new brand features lower levels of sugar and salt, as well as fewer calories than any of the Kellogg’s cereals, the paper reports. The small company’s offering is also free of preservatives and does not artificially add vitamins. In addition, its cereals are certified as organic. “Breakfast is really important to us, and we’re trying to get our menu to where we want it to be,” said Eric Goldstein, the chief executive of the Office of School Support Services, told the paper. “In the world we live in, though, there are so many constraints, so being able to offer Back to the Roots cereals for us is like a breath of fresh air. ” Up to 254, 000 children a day eats breakfast at New York City schools, according to district officials. The move to replace several of the Kellogg’s brands with the healthier choice comes on the heels of pressure from Congress, the state and some parents for schools to make better choices for school food programs. New York school officials also said that during the taste testing, kids chose the Back to the Roots brand over others. The district is still offering brands by the big cereal companies  —   General Mills, Post Foods, and even Kellogg’s, among them  —   but school administrators feel the new brands are offering a healthier choice. The big change in New York only adds to the woes of the Kellogg company, whose stock has been falling along with its market share. Only a month ago the company announced it was slashing its sales force, laying off over 1, 000 workers, and shuttering 39 distribution centers. The February announcement came on top of major cuts already announced this year. Early in January Kellogg Co. announced it was firing 250 workers. The multiple rounds of cutbacks occurred after Kellogg’s decided to cut its advertising with Breitbart News at the end of 2016, thereby snubbing Breitbart’s 45 million readers. In November, Kellogg’s noted that Breitbart News’s conservative readers are not “aligned with our values as a company. ” While the decision by Kellogg’s to cease advertising made virtually no revenue impact on Breitbart. com, it did represent an escalation in the war by leftist companies like Target and Allstate against conservative customers whose values propelled Donald Trump into the White House.

7908,7908,26644,One Year of Water in Orange County in Just Four Days - Breitbart,Breitbart,Adelle Nazarian,1/27/17,2017,1,,"Orange County received a more rain than it receives in one year over the course of four days of torrential downpours this week, leaving   reservoirs full again. [According to the Orange County Register, Irvine Lake rose 6 feet in one week and Barbara’s Lake was full again after being dry for the past year. Further, the Register reported that a review of reservoirs on the east side of the Santa Ana Mountain range on Thursday found Lake Skinner 85 percent full Diamond Valley Lake 72 percent full and Lake Mathews 90 percent full.  Just six months ago, those same lakes were reportedly dry. Nearly one year ago, Irvine Lake was forced to close its waters to recreational fishing after being a fishing hot spot for over 70 years. It is likely fishing activities will resume there in the near future. While the federal government’s U. S. Drought Monitor reported that approximately 35 percent of the state has exited the drought, it noted that “groundwater aquifers in many parts of the state remain severely overdrafted and will take far longer to recover. ” Two weeks ago, roughly 350 billion gallons of water came pouring into the region’s biggest reservoirs, boosting storage to levels not seen in years. Following that downpour, the U. S. Drought Monitor announced that 42 percent of California had been lifted out of the drought. That figure has likely increased as a result of the succeeding rains. While Northern California was almost completely   Southern California still has a a way to go. Jerry Vilander, general manager for the Serrano Water District, which oversees the Santiago Creek Reservoir (i. e.  Irvine Lake) told the Register that while four days of rain was equivalent to paying for three to four months of   water, “For the drought to be truly over we need a few more years’ supply in our pocket. ” Residents are still urged to use water frugally and judiciously.

7909,7909,26645,"Carr: Forty Years of Sex Abuse Catalogued at Elite NH Prep School of Kerry, Mueller - Breitbart",Breitbart,Howie Carr,5/25/17,2017,5,,"One of the nation’s most exclusive prep schools  —   whose graduates include both former Secretary of State John F. Kerry and the new Russia probe special counsel Robert Mueller  —   has just issued a scandalous,     report outlining four decades of   sexual abuse of students by faculty and administrators. [St. Paul’s School in Concord, NH, this week named 13 former faculty and staffers and also listed, without naming them, more than a dozen other former teachers and staffers who allegedly assaulted and raped various male and female students between 1948 and 1988.  The report was signed by Luther Scott Harshbarger, a former attorney general of Massachusetts, and was commissioned by the school’s board of trustees, whose chairman is Archibald Cox. Cox’s father was the late Watergate special counsel who was fired by   Richard Nixon in the   Saturday Night Massacre of 1973. Both Coxs are graduates of the school. Other famous Democrats who have graduated from the posh school with Episcopal roots include Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse ( ) and the late Michael Kennedy, son of Robert F. Kennedy. Jr. Kennedy was accused of having an affair with his family’s    babysitter before dying by skiing into a tree in Aspen in 1997. Other famous St. Paul’s alumni include former NYC Mayor John V. Lindsay and the late TV actor Efrem Zimbalist Jr. The late U. S. Rep. Gerry Studds ( ) the first openly homosexual member of Congress, taught at the school for years before abruptly resigning from the faculty in the early 1970s. A decade later Studds was censured by Congress for having an affair with a    male page after plying him with vodka and cranberry juice while on a foreign trip. Two years ago, a 2014 graduate of the elite prep school was convicted of sexually assaulting a then    female student. Owen Labrie’s appeal for a new trial was recently denied.  Other exclusive New England prep schools have in recent years admitted to decades of   sex scandals, including the Choate School in Wallingford, CT, from which President John F. Kennedy graduated. Last year, Philips Exeter Academy in Exeter, NH, was roiled by a sex scandal involving a former English teacher that came to light after the resignation of the headmaster, who was married to  . now Sen. Maggie Hasson.  But the new St. Paul’s report dwarfs all of the earlier accounts in its volume of detail, which includes accounts from dozens of former students, who are often quoted as describing the school as either “strange,” “creepy” or “very creepy. ” During his lifetime, Studds was unapologetic about his behavior with young males, including the    page with whom he had what he described as a “consensual” relationship. Studds was censured in the House by a vote of   after reading a statement defending his conduct with his back turned to his Congressional colleagues. A heterosexual Republican from downstate Illinois censured at the same time quickly resigned from Congress in shame. But Studds adamantly refused to quit and was subsequently reelected by his Massachusetts constituents. He died in 2006. One, Faculty 20, who taught there in “the late 1960’s,” once “molested” a male student in the front seat of his car and also reportedly held “dorm meetings in the nude with ‘all of the boys’ also nude in his   apartment. ” Another predatory homosexual teacher “in the late 1960’s and early 1970’s” was called Faculty 23. According to one account, an alumnus only identified as “Student 69” reported that this gay teacher “was in another male student’s dorm room and rubbed Vaseline on the student’s testicles. The male student was offended and requested that Faculty 23 stop. Faculty 23 allegedly threatened the student and said, ‘You can’t tell me what to do, I’m a teacher. ’” St. Paul’s often wrote glowing recommendations for the faculty perverts it wanted to get rid of. In one case listed in the report, one of the former teachers dismissed for “boundary issues with boys” was later fired from his new school for “inappropriate relationships” with his new male charges. A former vice rector at the school recalled getting a phone call from an administrator at the new school asking why St. Paul’s hadn’t accurately informed them of the educator’s record. The St. Paul’s administrator said he replied, “Why didn’t you contact us about him?” “We didn’t check his references,” the administrator said, “because he was coming from St. Paul’s. ” Howie Carr is a New York Times   author of Kennedy Babylon: A Century of Scandal and Depravity and a   talk radio host.

Although the court ruled in the opponents of the Trump order’s favor, the law still was on Trump’s side and that the Trump administration was using the “virtually the identical arguments” the Obama administration had used in defense of its immigration policy. “Well, it was a poorly crafted executive order, and it was a terrible rollout,” Turley said. “But I still think that the law favors the administration once you get to the merits. I don’t agree with many of those, some of those cases. But the courts have been highly deferential to the president, and they generally don’t  . I think the people also have to acknowledge that the Trump administration here is making virtually the identical argument to the Obama administration. ” “The Obama administration argued the president’s judgment on administration was largely unreviewable,” he continued. “He argued that he could even refuse or order the failure to enforce immigration laws. But the arguments were very, very similar. And for all the Democrats objecting now, I didn’t hear a peep of objection from them when just last year these arguments were being made by the same Justice Department. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"

And measured against my plan, this is hieroglyphics. Measured against my plan, this is like trying to learn a foreign language. And not just learn the language, but then learn all of the dialects and all the hidden meaning with the use of slang and so forth. It’s impossible. “Seven Reasons Why Obamacare 2. 0 Is All But Guaranteed to Impose Crushing Costs on Voters, Hurt Trump’s Base, and Hand Power Back to the Democrats. ” Okay, that’s the headline of the Breitbart piece. Let me ask you a question. I mean, the way I react when I see a headline like this, if it’s this bad, how in the world can the people in charge of it not know it’s this bad? If it is this bad, then why do the Republicans want to hand power back to the Democrats? Why do the Republicans want to hurt Trump’s base? Now, that I can answer. Why do Republicans want to impose crushing costs on voters? Does any of this make sense? And why do Republicans want to hand power back to the Democrats? And why does Trump want to do that? Trump supposedly signed on to this. Okay, so let’s take this incrementally. Now, at the bottom of this piece is perhaps the most important aspect of story with nothing to do with health care. “Sixty percent of adults are ‘hopeful and optimistic’ about America’s future. ” As asserted in this story, that’s from polling data. Sixty percent of adults are hopeful and optimistic? Now, as the Breitbart writer, Katie McHugh is her name, writer of the story. She says, “That’s a precious opportunity, one that shouldn’t be wasted. ” “‘The issue now is about Americans looking to not get f —  ed over. If we deliver, we’ll get 60 percent of the white vote, and 40 percent of the black and Hispanic vote and we’ll govern for 50 years,’ White House Chief strategist Steve Bannon said during a November interview. ‘That’s what the Democrats missed  …     They lost sight of what the world is about. ’” Bannon, chief strategist for Trump  …     So Breitbart claims here that this Obamacare repeal and replacement bill actually targets senior citizens in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin and makes their tax credits less effective and raises their health care costs.

7913,7913,26649,"Shaun King, The Nation’s Whitest Black Activist, ’Boycotts’ NFL for ’Bigotry’ and ’Anti-Blackness’",Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,6/7/17,2017,6,,"On Tuesday, Shaun King, the “senior justice writer” for the New York Daily News, announced his boycott of the National Football League. The former black lives matter spokesman, deposed after the discovery that he is white and not the African American he claimed to be, accused the NFL of being “bigoted” against black people because it hasn’t hired   protester Colin Kaepernick. [King made his proclamation after it became clear that American anthem protester and former San Francisco 49ers   quarterback Colin Kaepernick would not find a team to take him on after he became a free agent at the tail of last season.  Kaepernick spent the entirety of the   season refusing to stand for the national anthem and spoke out against the U. S. A. our police, soldiers, and other first responders. He also repeatedly said the country was “never great. ” But after the season ended, in February the player announced both his free agency and an end to his     protests. But despite his new status and his pledge to end his embarrassing protests, Kaepernick has not been able to find a team to hire him for the coming football season. His inability to find a berth has sparked numerous protests by   fans and   sports reporters alike. Kaepernick was even the subject of a politician’s decree when a   socialist Seattle City Council member wrote an open letter demanding that the Seattle Seahawks bring him on. The demands ultimately fell on deaf ears. With Kaepernick left out in the cold,   football fan Shaun King now says he can’t watch football anymore. “I can’t, in good conscience, support this league, with many of its   owners, as it blacklists my friend and brother Colin Kaepernick for taking a silent, peaceful stance against injustice and police brutality in America,” King blathered in his June 6 column. “It’s disgusting and has absolutely nothing to do with football and everything to do with penalizing a brilliant young man for the principled stance he took last season. ” The white man who posed as a black man for a decade fulminated at Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll for turning his back on Kaepernick and signing white quarterback Austin Davis instead. King labeled Davis a “scrub” over the incident. King, who admitted that he lied about being black, went on to rail at the Seahawks for hiring Davis who has far fewer accomplishments in the NFL than Kaepernick. The activist insisted that there could be only one reason that the Seahawks took a pass on Kaepernick: It’s racism. It’s bigotry. It’s discrimination. Period. It’s not football. Don’t call it football. If you call the decisions by 32 teams to not sign this man a football decision, you don’t know football and probably voted for Donald Trump. Nearly 100 quarterbacks —  96, in fact —  are usually signed to teams in the NFL. That Colin Kaepernick is not one of them is disgusting. Of course, he’s one of the top 96 quarterbacks in the league. Kaepernick’s longtime rival, Richard Sherman, said he believed Kaepernick was a   quarterback. King went on to add that the “ridiculous fragility of the conservative white male fan base” has kept Kaepernick on the sidelines. Finally, this very white “black activist” added that his decision was sealed when ESPN announced that it had rehired country singer Hank Williams, Jr. to once again sing his iconic Monday Night Football theme song at the start of each Monday game. Williams had been fired six years ago for being a conservative. “Hank Williams, Jr. is basically Donald Trump with a guitar. He’s a bigot,” King growled. “Everybody knows it. His songs and statements have echoed bigotry for years, but now that Obama is out of office, he’s back. ” King continued, bellowing: Hank Williams, Jr. and Austin Davis are employed right now, and Colin Kaepernick isn’t. Shame on this league for following Trump’s lead in spirit, tone and now in actions. I’m appalled. As a lifelong fan, I’m deeply disappointed. What I do know is this —  I can’t support this product. Warming to his closing statements, King then blamed his little son for launching the boycott with a claim that his    boy told him they could no longer watch football, “After what they’ve done to Colin and with all of those owners loving Donald Trump so much. ” So, in the face of all this purported “injustice,” King has set out on his road to boycotting the NFL: Maybe if Colin Kaepernick gets a deal, it would change my mind, but deep damage is already done. As a leader in the Black Lives Matter Movement, as a voice in the resistance to Donald Trump, and as a friend of Colin Kaepernick, I cannot, in good conscience, support the NFL any longer. If I did, I’d struggle to look my own son in the eyes or look at myself in the mirror. As a reminder, King is boycotting a sports league that is almost 70 percent African American. It is a business where the average rookie salary is $365, 000 a year, a number that goes up by tens of thousands every year the player stays signed to an NFL team. It is also a league where the average player’s salary is about $1. 9 million annually. This is the same sports league that Shaun King says isn’t black enough and is unfair and discriminatory to blacks. But, this is also a man who directly equates   to being “tolerant” and right thinking. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com."

7916,7916,26652,Knesset Bill Proposes Annexing All Jerusalem-Area Settlements,Breitbart,Deborah Danan,2/13/17,2017,2,,"TEL AVIV  —   A new bill to annex the settlements around Jerusalem will be submitted to the Knesset this week, the Jerusalem Post reported. [MK Yehuda Glick (Likud) is advancing the private member’s legislation, which would cover   of the 386, 000 settlers in Judea and Samaria residing in communities including Ma’aleh Adumim, Givat Ze’ev, Adam, Psagot, Ma’aleh Michmash and the Gush Etzion bloc.  A similar bill annexing Ma’aleh Adumim has been submitted and is awaiting approval from the Ministerial Committee for Legislation. But according to Glick, annexing Ma’aleh Adumim alone is not enough. Applying sovereignty to all the communities around Jerusalem would strengthen the capital and distance the notion of a Palestinian state, Glick said. He added that the bill has already garnered support from Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely and Transportation Minister Israel Katz. He noted that his bill comes at an auspicious time, ahead of the 50th anniversary of the Six Day War that saw Judea and Samaria liberated from Jordan, and as such this should be “the year of sovereignty. ” The new bill comes on the heels of a series of annexation attempts put forward by nationalist politicians here since President Donald Trump came into office. So far, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not supported efforts toward annexation, fearing it would cause too much backlash from the U. S. and international community. Instead, he favors a scenario in which the U. S. would lend its support for building within existing settlements. A group of nationalist politicians from the Knesset Land of Israel Caucus published an open letter to Netanyahu Sunday, urging him “to seize the opportunity provided by the entry of the new U. S. administration   …     [and] prevent the establishment of an Arab terrorist state in the Land of Israel, and to stand for freedom, prosperity and building of communities throughout Judea and Samaria. ”  "

7919,7919,26655,David Frum: NRA Members Not Up to Task of Repelling Tyrants - Breitbart,Breitbart,AWR Hawkins,5/5/17,2017,5,,"On May 5 David Frum tweeted that the message of Cinco de Mayo is that repelling a tyranny requires a “proper army” rather than “a bunch of NRA members. ”[His tweet:  Message of CInco de Mayo: if your country is invaded by tyrants, you want a proper army to stop them, not a bunch of NRA members,  —   David Frum (@davidfrum) May 5, 2013,  Frum sent this tweet exactly one week after numerous speakers at the   Leadership Forum reaffirmed our Founding Fathers’ intention that U. S. citizens were armed to repel a tyranny. Senator Ted Cruz ( ) stressed this message when reminding NRA members why the right to keep and bear arms is so important. Cruz said: When the Second Amendment was drafted it wasn’t about hunting. Hunting is a lot of fun. In Texas I enjoy hunting. Target shooting is great fun. The Second Amendment is not about target shooting either. The reason the Second Amendment is in the Bill of Rights is because the Second Amendment reflects the fundamental right of each and every one of us to protect our homes and our families and our children from anyone that would seek to do them harm. And the Second Amendment was also designed as a check on government tyranny. That an armed citizenry is a free and independent citizenry empowered to defend our fundamental liberties. Cruz’s words are a reflection of James Madison’s message in Federalist 46, wherein Madison explained that Americans are exceptional because armed, and the citizens’ right to bear arms ensures that they can band together to repel tyranny from an overreaching central government. Looked at in another light, Frum’s tweet is reminiscent of the kind of haughty statements made by British military leadership during the American Revolution. After all, that was a war in which new world colonists —  largely unorganized and without military training, particularly in the South —  rose up to defeat a   and fully militarized British Army. Their motivation was freedom through victory they were determined to cast off the yoke of King George III, with its myriad taxations and the subsequent deprivation of liberty. The NRA’s fight is likewise a fight for freedom —  and it is one they are winning. Commentators like Frum and   despots who believe the American people are willing to trade their freedom for an overbearing government have missed, not only the last 10 years of the NRA’s expansion in members and power, but   American gun owners’ determination to live in liberty’s shadow.

While many have made comparisons to Trump’s handling of Comey to Watergate, Schieffer said he saw “parallels” to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy. “You know, there are many parallels Watergate,” Schieffer explained. “But I have to tell you, I think all the way back to the Kennedy assassination, to draw parallels. I was there, as you know. I have always felt that if Lee Harvey Oswald had been put on trial, a lot of these conspiracy theories that are still circulating today would have been put at rest then. It is absolutely imperative that Donald Trump finds a way to reassure the American people that these questions about Russia are not true if that is his version. He’s got to lay it all out and find ways not just to tweet out every morning the news is being made up by the news media. ” “He’s got to show some proof,” he continued. “He has got to give them some reason to believe that these things are not true. Frankly, unless he is able to do this, this is going to dog his presidency for the rest of his term. Look at what’s happened in Washington right now. It’s come to a complete stop while the country and Washington tries to digest the firing of James Comey. Putting this to rest is not going to be helped by firing the guy who was doing the investigation. Sending these people out to explain the inexplicable is not going to help. He’s making fools of his own staff. The White House appears to be in chaos. It is the original amateur hour as we look at it from the outside.

[Brock, who founded the   watchdog Media Matters for America as well as Super PACs such as Correct the Record and American Bridge sees himself as a key figure in rebuilding the Democratic Party following Donald Trump’s ascent to the presidency.  Recently, Brock has pleaded for funding to help him build an   war room, which seeks to hold the the current administration accountable on a daily basis and, in his own words, “kick Trump’s ass. ” He aspires to make his Shareblue website “the Breitbart of the Left. ” However, according to multiple sources at The Daily Beast, many Democrats believe he damages the party and just wish he would go away. Talking to The Daily Beast, Bernie Sanders’s 2016 presidential campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, described Brock’s ability to improve the party’s electability as “nonexistent,” adding that “he does not have the kind of understanding of what kind of coalition you have to bring together to win national races. ” “I don’t think David Brock has been helpful to the party to date, and I don’t think he will be a big part of its future,”a former Clinton campaign official also told the news site, while another said that they “did not want to deal with Brock’s bullshit,” describing his   campaign efforts as “useless,” adding that “you might as well have thrown those [tens of] millions of dollars down a well, and then set the well on fire. ” A source close to The Daily Beast also said that while Brock had reached out to various Clinton campaign staff to join his “war room” effort, they all declined because “no one wants anything to do with him. ” Other former employees of Brock also said that he tends to “overstate his level of impact and importance,” adding that “that he cares less about progressive policies and moving the ball forward, and is actually more focused on stroking his ego. ” Brock’s main project, the   watchdog Media Matters for America group, was in 2012 exposed as attempting the wholesale destruction of conservative media. A leaked internal document showed that Brock’s organization hoped to “bring litigation against Fox News and its feeders. ” However, the organization now reportedly pivots its focus towards Breitbart, instead of FOX News. Another one of Brock’s organizations, Correct the Record, spent $1 million to hire online trolls to “correct” supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) across social media. Defending his record, Brock told The Daily Beast that “people are free to question my motives, but it should be pretty clear by now that the groups that I’ve created are committed to a more progressive America.“ “I’m interested in building   organizational capacity to resist and oppose Donald Trump,” he continued. “I think that should be everybody’s goal on the left, to destroy Donald Trump, not to destroy each other. ” You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com"

S. economy gained 227, 000 jobs in January according to statistics released by the Labor Department on Friday, while unemployment ticked up slightly to 4. 8 percent. [Wages also increased 2. 5 percent compared to January 2016, rising six cents in December.  The economy added 157, 000 jobs in December and unemployment stood at 4. 7 percent. A number of companies announced before Trump’s inauguration they planned to expand in the U. S. not overseas, and hire American workers.

Employers have also found themselves managing a tighter employment market, according to the New York Times: Regardless of government estimates, however, employers across sectors and across the nation have increasingly complained about the difficulty of finding workers, a competition that kept the increase in the average hourly wage ahead of a 1. 6 percent price inflation rate. “We’re still continuing to see wage pressure as the candidate market continues to shrink,” said Amy Glaser, senior vice president of Adecco Staffing USA, which has 300 branch offices. In addition to the omnipresent hunger for engineers, Ms. Glaser said there is a demand for those with   trade skills like welding that fell into disuse during the recession, as well as   warehouse and light assembly workers. “Employers are getting very creative,” said Ms. Glaser, whose office is in Lexington, Ky. “We’re seeing   bonuses. They have added sabbaticals to their packages, increases to stock options, free child care on site and free meals. Anything to get a competitive edge. ” After Election Day, many companies, especially small businesses, responded with soaring optimism.

S. embassy to Jerusalem, but a recent diplomatic spat showed why it has been so hard for him to do so. [On Monday, the Times of Israel reported that talks between U. S. and Israeli officials coordinating Trump’s upcoming visit to the Western Wall  —   the holiest site in Judaism  —   stumbled when a “senior American official” said that the area was not within Israeli control and was part of the West Bank.  That is the official position of President Barack Obama’s administration, and of UN Security Council Resolution 2334, Obama’s parting shot against the Jewish state. It is not clear who, exactly, the “senior American official” was, but Israel’s Ha’aretz identified the culpable parties as “diplomats stationed at the U. S. consulate in Jerusalem. ” The consulate is located in eastern Jerusalem and has long been regarded as more sympathetic to the Palestinians. (Update: The name of the official has since been reported as David Berns, a career bureaucrat at State.) The Trump administration disavowed that official’s view. But generally, it is difficult to overstate the degree to which the career bureaucracy disapproves of moving the U. S. embassy  —   and not just in the State Department. There are various reasons given, from possible prejudice to peace talks with the Palestinians, to repercussions in U. S. relations with Arab and Muslim countries. Still, it is difficult to distinguish the arguments against moving the embassy from the arguments against recognizing Israel in the first place. Already, the Trump administration has been grappling with the challenge of working with Obama administration holdovers in the bureaucracy who have not yet been replaced. Add to that the fact that there are members of the   “deep state” who are actively undermining the president, through leaks and other methods, and you have a formidable obstacle to progress  —   one to which Trump’s predecessors yielded, and which Trump alone can defeat.

7924,7924,26660,Upcoming Horror Game ’Outlast 2’ Banned in Australia - Breitbart,Breitbart,Nate Church,3/17/17,2017,3,,"  survival horror game Outlast 2 has been denied classification by the Australian Classification Board, effectively banning it from sale in Australia. [While the original Outlast and its Whistleblower expansion contained numerous scenes of graphic violence, and Outlast 2 looks to follow that trend based on the demo that was released last year, that’s not the reason given for its ban. The game has reportedly been refused even the   R18+ rating due to “a depiction of implied sexual violence” in one part of the game (SPOILER WARNING):  In one   in the game   …     a female creature prepares Blake for a ritual. She says, “I want to see your true face. Your seed will burn this world. ” Shortly afterwards, he objects to having   dust blown into his face, yelling, “Nope! Nope!” before he stumbles into a forest clearing. His vision blurring, he witnesses what appears to a ritualistic orgy. His wife, Lynn, calls out for his help, saying, “It hurts! Oh god! ,” as she hangs from chains on a raised platform at the front of the clearing. Humanoid creatures, their skin grey, spattered with blood and scarred, implicity have sex as others pray, or chant, or gesticulate. One creature has another bent over a rock, thrusting as they implicitly have   sex, another sits astride the pelvic region of a creature prone on the ground, moving their hips rhythmically as they too implicitly have sex. Two other pairs of creatures in the clearing are also implicitly having sex. As Blake yells for the creatures to “Get away from her!” a female creature, her greyish breasts bared, pushes him onto his back, holds his arms to the ground and repeatedly thrusts her crotch against him. As Blake protests, saying “No! Stop that!” the creature thrusts again, before placing its face over his midsection and then sitting up and wiping its mouth. Their conclusion: Although much of the contact between the creature and Blake is obscurred, by it taking place below screen, the sexualised surroundings and aggressive behaviour of the creature suggest that it is an assault which is sexual in nature. The Board is of the opinion that this, combined with Blake’s objections and distress, constitutes a depiction of implied sexual violence. In the Board’s opinion, the above example constitutes a depiction of implied sexual violence and therefore cannot be accommodated within the R18+ classification category and the game is therefore Refused Classification. This is not the only content on which the refusal was based but seems to be the final straw for members of the board. Developer Red Barrels will be forced to decide between heavily censoring their game or being refused the opportunity to sell it to Australian consumers. While the sequence depicted above is undoubtedly horrific, it’s important to remember that Outlast 2 is, in fact, a horror game. Its content is roughly equivalent to what you would expect from any of the copious   horrors in books or films  —   areas in which the Australian Classification Board is decidedly more lenient. Games are no stranger to exceptional scrutiny and subjected to a broad spectrum of myths about their comparative effects on empathy and development, against all evidence to the contrary. For now, developers must regularly choose between delivering content as it was originally intended or being permitted to sell their products in countries with zealous media restrictions in place.

[Sky News reports that Butt, who they say came to Britain with his parents from Pakistan as asylum seekers, worked for Transport for London.  Further reports indicate Butt’s work gave him access to tunnels under the Houses of Parliament from the Westminster Underground Station  —   despite the fact he had been investigated for terror links by MI5 and even been featured on a Channel 4 documentary about   Islamists titled ‘The Jihadis Next Door‘. Pakistani security officials told The Telegraph newspaper that raids on homes and businesses connected to the Butt family were being carried out as a precaution, but that the terrorist was likely radicalised in Britain and trained in Syria. “Our British counterparts told us they don’t think he was radicalised here, and we think it is probably more likely that he was trained in Syria,” one said. “But we are searching the homes of any relatives connected to him and we are tracing all telephone calls made by family members. ” The news comes as Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley declared Britain was now facing a “completely different” level of threat and indicated that current policing and security methods are not equal to the task of containing it. “In nine weeks, we’ve had five plots foiled and three successful attacks. That is completely different to anything we have seen for a long time,” he said. “As the Prime Minister has indicated, we’re going to need to do some things differently. We’re going to have to think again about the next iteration of our police and security service model, which has constantly had to innovate over many decades. ” Regarding Butt, the Assistant Commissioner defended the decision to drop an inquiry into his activities by saying there was “no intelligence to suggest that this attack was being planned”. He added that he expected the authorities “will probably discover information on covert communications that were [not in] our knowledge that if we had access to those communications it may have changed our judgment” suggesting he wants new powers to monitor encrypted messaging services such as WhatsApp."
7927,7927,26663,The New Yorker: ‘How Steve Bannon Conquered CPAC and the Republican Party’,Breitbart,Breitbart News,2/24/17,2017,2,,"The New Yorker’s Ryan Lizza writes that the populist nationalist worldview of Donald Trump’s White House chief strategist Steve Bannon has finally “conquered” the American Conservative Union’s annual CPAC conference. [As Lizza notes, the issues that animate Bannon’s worldview and propelled Trump to victory were left off the CPAC agenda in the 2013 conference following Mitt Romney’s failed presidential campaign. That year, Bannon, then the executive chairman of Breitbart News, organized an “Uninvited” panel of speakers to discuss such pressing topics as illegal immigration, crony capitalism, and radical Islam.  From The New Yorker: The   appearance was a reminder of how quickly Bannon’s view of conservatism came to defeat Priebus’s. Back in March, 2013, Bannon was something of an outcast at CPAC. In the wake of Mitt Romney’s loss in the 2012 Presidential election, conservatives were trying to emphasize their movement’s diversity and tolerance. The prevailing takeaway from the election was that the right had grown too old, too white, and too intolerant —  and so CPAC, which often serves as an incubator for ideas emerging on the far right, needed to downplay the fringes of the movement.   …     Bannon, who was the head of Breitbart News, roamed the halls as a disgruntled and dishevelled fringe player. Before the conference, he had scanned the schedule and complained that CPAC’s organizers had cast out the voices representing what he viewed as the real issues on the right: the threat from Islam, illegal immigration, and corporate America’s influence on politics. He organized an evening of counterprograming to highlight those issues, which he called the Uninvited. Even at the most conservative gathering in America, Bannon liked to play the role of aggrieved outsider. On the CPAC sidelines, Bannon described his alternative lineup to an interviewer: “A former Attorney General from the Bush Administration talking about jihad and the élites’ inability to recognize it. Peter Schweitzer talking about crony capitalism. Pam Geller, Robert Spencer, Frank Gaffney, Nina Shea talking about the global persecution of Christians. These are huge topics. Illegal immigration. These are huge issues. They have to be vetted. ” Read the rest here. "

7930,7930,26666,Iran Conducts ’Unsafe and Unprofessional’ Encounter With U.S. Ships,Breitbart,John Hayward,3/6/17,2017,3,,"On Saturday, several   boats of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) approached a U. S. Navy ship in the Strait of Hormuz at high speed in the latest “unsafe and unprofessional” action by Iranian forces. [A U. S. official told Reuters about the incident on Monday:  The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the IRGCN boats came within 600 yards of the USNS Invincible, a tracking ship, and stopped. The Invincible was being accompanied by three ships from British Royal Navy and forced the formation to change course. The official said attempts were made to communicate over radio, but there was no response and the interaction was “unsafe and unprofessional. ” “The Invincible is a Stalwart class ocean surveillance ship  —   known as a tracking ship  —   that is equipped with antennas and electronics to support the tracking and launching of missiles and rockets,” explains Radio Free Europe. CBS News notes this was the second close encounter between the Invincible and Iranian naval forces in just two days: The “unsafe” encounter came just two days after an Iranian navy frigate came within 150 yards of the Invincible in the Gulf of Oman, just south of the Strait of Hormuz. The gulf separates Oman from southeastern Iran. The earlier encounter was deemed “unprofessional” but not unsafe because the frigate maintained a parallel course with the Invincible at the point of closest approach. The Saturday incident was also more worrying as it involved the elite Revolutionary Guard unit. According to Fox News, Iran   a pair of ballistic missiles into the Gulf of Oman over the weekend. It was the first time     ballistic missiles have been tested in two years. One of the missiles successfully destroyed a target barge at a range of 155 miles. One of the missiles launched from the IRGC base in    successfully destroyed a target barge at a range of 155 miles. The other missed its target. U.

During the interview, Assange discussed the idea of “fake news” and how WikiLeaks’ refusal to editorialize their content and rather provide pure data to the public has allowed them to publish facts without bias.  “What is special about WikiLeaks is that it’s not just another damn story,” said Assange, “it’s not just another damn journalist putting their damn byline, advertising themselves and their position on another damn story. ” “You’re not reading   knowledge,” Assange said in discussing WikiLeaks vast database of information. “When you read a newspaper article, you are reading weaponised text that is designed to affect a person just like you  …     I think that is the real beauty of WikiLeaks  …     it is that sea of information, that treasure, that intellectual treasure, that rebel library of Alexandria you can go into. ” Surprisingly, Assange said that he was quite happy to see the narrative of “fake news” being pushed by the media, claiming so far WikiLeaks has a 100% correct record when it comes to verifiable information. “When the narrative of fake news came out and was then taken off effectively by the   press and pushed around  …     I could see exactly where that was going. I was rather happy about it,” Assange said. “WikiLeaks is very happy that there is a narrative about fake news out there because we have a perfect record of having never got it wrong in terms of authentications. ” “The real value in WikiLeaks is it is a wonderful library that you can trust  …     But the library has to be marketed.

So that’s publishing it at the moment when they most want to read it, when they most want to know what it contains. And that’s definitely before an election rather than after election. ” When asked about the accuracy of the released emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, Assange said, “We had lots of critics in the Democratic Party, liars in the Democratic Party  …     saying that what we published was not accurate  —   trying to imitate it, sometimes saying it directly.

[Speaking to Kleine Zeitung, the Formula 1 investor called the decision of key politicians to open the borders  —   which resulted in Europe’s migration crisis  —   “unpardonable” noting that “if a company were to make mistakes on the same scale, it would have gone broke”. Highlighting the “hypocrisies” of what he called the “refugees welcome brigade” with regards to migration, Mateschitz said: “I am talking about the fact that none of the people shouting ‘refugees welcome’ or [Chancellor Angela Merkel’s famous phrase] ‘we can do it’ were preparing their own guest rooms or tents in their gardens to accommodate half a dozen migrants. “Even then it was clear to everyone that most of the people [arriving in the continent] did not correspond to the definition of the refugee. In any case, not the Geneva Convention”. In the interview, Mateschitz took a stand against the “destabilisation of Europe” which he said threatens the “uniqueness of [the continent’s] diversity and individuality with its different cultures and languages”. “I hope I’m not the only one who’s worried that one of the highest officials in Brussels said that countries which aren’t multicultural should be wiped off the map” Mateschitz told the newspaper, possibly alluding to comments made by European Commission   Frans Timmermans in 2015. “Any society, anywhere in the world, will be diverse in the future  —   that’s the future of the world,” Timmermans said, demanding that Eastern and Central EU nations undergo similar demographic transitions to Western Europe. Of political correctness, Mateschitz said: “It seems that no one dares to tell the truth, even if everyone knows what the truth is. ”“The elites want citizens to be frightened, and easily manipulated,” he added.  The Red Bull founder said he sees numerous problems plaguing the European Union (EU) the architects of whom he fingered as belonging to a “  intellectual elite” with nothing to contribute to the continent. “Policies which are steeped in political correctness have been imposed in the name of a     intellectual elite who have nothing to contribute to our country neither economically nor culturally despite their best intentions,” he said. Mateschitz also poured scorn on how Russia has been framed as the EU’s nemesis by large parts of the media and Western liberal establishment, telling Kleine Zeitung: “I do not need anyone to tell me who my enemies are. ”Criticising attempts to destroy the former Soviet superpower through economic sanctions, the Formula 1 investor pointed out that “for Europe as a whole [this policy] results in losing billions of Euros”. Challenged by the Austrian newspaper with the assertion that he too is an ‘elite’ Mateschitz hit back, describing himself as a “humanist” but “someone who basically opposes any dogma”. Speaking about banning the Islamic veil, a talking point in Austria currently, the Red Bull boss said: “I can’t bring myself to think that this is really a matter of any importance   …     It’s silly to make a political issue out of something like this when there are far more pressing matters. ”"
7937,7937,26673,‘Scandal’ Star Tony Goldwyn Applauds ‘Lifesaving’ Planned Parenthood,Breitbart,Dr. Susan Berry,3/28/17,2017,3,,"Scandal star Tony Goldwyn hailed what he called Planned Parenthood’s “lifesaving work” for women’s health care in an interview this week, adding that those those who oppose abortion are actually “sabotaging” their “own moral stance. ”[Goldwyn, who plays the role of POTUS on the hit ABC show, wore a Planned Parenthood pin to the PaleyFest television festival in Hollywood this week. The actor says   activists are wrong to think putting an end to abortion will save lives.  “There’s been a lot of disinformation about Planned Parenthood and the focus of the lifesaving work that they do for women’s health care,” the actor told Glamour magazine in an interview, adding: “I saw a   image of all those white men sitting around in a room at the White House talking about what should be done about women’s health care, and I thought I would step up [by wearing this and speaking out]. If Planned Parenthood is defunded, millions of women, particularly women struggling economically, are going to be in serious trouble. And the truth is, there will be far more abortions performed —  and unsafe ones as a result. The people that are antiabortion actually are sabotaging their own moral stance by taking this position. ” Glamour writer Jessica Radloff praised Goldwyn for his support of the abortion giant, and also cited Planned Parenthood’s already debunked “3 percent” statistic: “As we’ve pointed out numerous times, abortion constitutes just 3 percent of Planned Parenthood’s services, and except in cases of rape, incest, or severe threat to a mother’s life, no federal money is used to fund abortion services. But cutting federal funding for PP would put access to breast exams, Pap tests, colposcopy procedures, HPV vaccines, reversible contraception procedures, pregnancy tests, STI tests, and HIV tests at risk. ” Live Action’s   video demonstrates how the abortion chain calculates its deceptive “3 percent statistic” by dividing the number of abortions it performs by the total number of services it provides, counting a $10 pregnancy test or a package of condoms as equivalent to a $500 abortion.  “To justify its half billion dollars in taxpayer funding, Planned Parenthood downplays abortion  —   falsely claiming that it only makes up three percent of its business  —   and instead plays up its cancer screenings and   ‘women’s health care,’” explains Lila Rose, president of Live Action. Rose adds: According to its own annual reports, Planned Parenthood does less than one percent of all Pap tests in the United States, less than two percent of all clinical breast exams, zero mammograms, and virtually no prenatal care, yet it does 34. 9 percent of all U. S. abortions, killing over 320, 000 preborn children every year. Former Planned Parenthood managers have provided testimonials about how the abortion giant uses quotas to push   abortions, doesn’t provide the health care it claims it does, and “treats women like cattle. ” In fact, when President Donald Trump offered Planned Parenthood the opportunity to keep its taxpayer funding if it would stop performing abortions, the group’s officials rejected the offer. Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards even tweeted that its abortion services were “as vital to our mission as birth control or cancer screenings. ” Planned Parenthood is proud to provide abortion —  a necessary service that’s as vital to our mission as birth control or cancer screenings. https:  .   —   Cecile Richards (@CecileRichards) March 6, 2017,    activists are urging Congress and Trump to eliminate Planned Parenthood’s taxpayer funding and redirect it to other community health care centers that provide more comprehensive healthcare services than Planned Parenthood. These community facilities outnumber the abortion business’s clinics by at least 20 to 1."

Yes, 22 million people got insurance through the ACA. So, that’s a plus. Our uninsurance rate now hovers around 10% and if all the states had expanded Medicaid, it would be even lower. On costs, yes costs have gone up, but they’ve gone up much more slowly than they did under President Bush, and they’ve moderated. For example, under President Bush, insurance premiums for employers went up 80% while under President Obama, they went up 35% a substantial reduction in the growth of healthcare costs. So, cost control has actually been significantly improved. And then in terms of quality, we’ve seen hospital readmission rates within 30 days of discharge going down. We’ve seen improvements in infections in hospitals, in no thromboemboli, no falls. So, whether it’s access, cost, or coverage, the Affordable Care Act has been an improvement. That doesn’t mean it’s been a home run on every one of them, but a significant improvement. ” He added that “in any big piece of legislation, for 300 million Americans, there are going to be some winners and losers. And mostly those losers were young, healthy people who were getting a great deal by the insurance companies, because they were young and healthy. ” He added that “Young healthy families of people who were in their 30s with two young kids, who don’t use a lot of healthcare, got a great deal. But people who needed healthcare didn’t get a great deal. Remember, if we’re going to cover everyone, including people with illnesses, it’s  —   the cost is going to have to be spread out over people. Some people actually, unfortunately, did get price increases. The best solution to the price increases is to moderate healthcare cost growth, and the Affordable Care Act began us on a process to do that, and it is unfortunate that deductibles have gone up. I would note, the Republicans want to increase deductibles even more, and so, that’s not a solution to the problem. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"
7940,7940,26676,Fix Is In: House Committee on ’Russian Hacking’ Includes Only DNC-Hired Tech Experts,Breitbart,Lee Stranahan,3/9/17,2017,3,,"A list of witnesses scheduled to appear at a House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Open Hearing on “Russian Active Measures” contains a glaring problem: the only technical experts scheduled to testify are from CrowdStrike. CrowdStrike is a firm hired by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and has become the primary source of the narrative about “Russian hacking” of the 2016 election and has acted as a mouthpiece for the Democrats since last June. [The initial witness list released by House Intelligence includes a number of intelligence officials, all appointed during the Obama administration, such as former CIA Director John Brennan, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, but the sole technical people on the invitation list are two representatives of CrowdStrike, President Shawn Henry, and the   Dmitri Alperovitch.  Breitbart News has interviewed tech experts who do not agree with the CrowdStrike assessment or Obama administration’s claims that the   hacks clearly committed by Russian state actors, with much criticism aimed at the   Joint Analysis Report (JAR) “Grizzly Steppe” that was released at the end of December. As ZDNet reported after the JAR report was released by the Obama administration on the same day that they announced sanctions against Russia: The JAR included “specific indicators of compromise, including IP addresses and a PHP malware sample. ” But what does this really prove? Wordfence, a WordPress security company specializing in analyzing PHP malware, examined these indicators and didn’t find any hard evidence of Russian involvement. Instead, Wordfence found the attack software was P. AS. 3. 1. 0, an      hacking tool. The newest version, 4. 1. 1b, is more sophisticated. Its website claims it was written in the Ukraine. Mark Maunder, Wordfence’s CEO, concluded that since the attacks were made “several versions behind the most current version of P. A. S sic which is 4. 1. 1b. One might reasonably expect Russian intelligence operatives to develop their own tools or at least use current malicious tools from outside sources. ” True, as Errata Security CEO Rob Graham pointed out in a blog post, P. A. S is popular among   hackers. But it’s “used by hundreds if not thousands of hackers, mostly associated with Russia, but also throughout the rest of the world. ” In short, just because the attackers used P. A. S. that’s not enough evidence to blame it on the Russian government. Independent cybersecurity experts, such as Jeffrey Carr, have cited numerous errors that the media and CrowdStrike have made in discussing the hacking in what Carr refers to as a “runaway train” of misinformation. For example, CrowdStrike has named a threat group that they have given the name “Fancy Bear” for the hacks and then said this threat group is Russian intelligence. In December 2016, Carr wrote in a post on Medium: A common misconception of “threat group” is that [it] refers to a group of people. It doesn’t. Here’s how ESET describes SEDNIT, one of the names for the threat group known as APT28, Fancy Bear, etc. This definition is found on p. 12 of part two “En Route with Sednit: Observing the Comings and Goings”: As security researchers, what we call “the Sednit group” is merely a set of software and the related network infrastructure, which we can hardly correlate with any specific organization. Unlike CrowdStrike, ESET doesn’t assign     to a Russian Intelligence Service or anyone else for a very simple reason. Once malware is deployed, it is no longer under the control of the hacker who deployed it or the developer who created it. It can be   copied, modified, shared and redeployed again and again by anyone. Despite these and other criticisms from technical experts with no political axe to grind, the House Intelligence committee has called no independent cybersecurity professionals to challenge the Democrats’ claims of “Russian hacking” that have been repeated ad naseum by the media. Instead of presenting   to allow the general public to make up their own minds, the House committee has invited Shawn Henry and Dmitri Alperovitch from CrowdStrike, The danger is especially high since the subject involves technical details that the public —  and, frankly, most politicians —  don’t understand and can be easily fooled about. A presentation with no rebuttal at all from other technical experts will lead to even more disinformation being given to the American people. There are a number of reasons to be skeptical of the objectivity of CrowdStrike’s assessments. As Esquire reported in a long profile piece, the DNC specifically used Alperovitch and Henry as part of an   publicity plan related to the hacking in early June 2016: The DNC wanted to go public. At the committee’s request, Alperovitch and Henry briefed a reporter from The Washington Post about the attack.   …     Alperovitch told me he was thrilled that the DNC decided to publicize Russia’s involvement. “Having a client give us the ability to tell the full story” was a “milestone in the industry,” he says. “Not just highlighting a rogue  ’s actions but explaining what was taken and how and when. These stories are almost never told. ” The Esquire piece also indicates that as the election wore on, the Obama administration was also using Alperovitch and CrowdStrike’s claims to push the Democrat narrative that the Russians were behind the attack: On October 7, two days before the second presidential debate, Alperovitch got a phone call from a senior government official alerting him that a statement identifying Russia as the sponsor of the DNC attack would soon be released. (The statement, from the office of the director of national intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security, appeared later that day.) It is worth noting that CrowdStrike and Alperovitch’s story has evolved over time to match a Democrat narrative. In an article in Inc. on June 14, 2016, titled “Why the DNC Hired This Cybersecurity Firm to Fight Russian Spies,” Alperovitch claimed that the purpose of the DNC hack was to expose Donald Trump: On Tuesday, it was revealed that the Russian government is implicated in a security breach of the Democratic National Committee’s computer network, through which opposition research on the bombastic presidential candidate was lifted. “Every world leader is trying to figure out who Mr. Trump is, especially if he’s elected president, and they want to know what his foreign policies would be. Russia is no exception,” says Dmitri Alperovitch,   and CTO of CrowdStrike. His firm was hired to manage the breach. “The actors are also interested in any other information the DNC might have in their opposition research to use it against Trump if he becomes president,” says Alperovitch, who leads the Intelligence, Technology and CrowdStrike Labs teams. There is no justification for a technical expert like Alperovitch ascribing motives to the hackers or making statements about what “world leaders” think. It is simply outside his area of expertise, but the point of the Democrats using Alperovitch and Henry to promote their “Russian hacking” narrative is to provide a technical veneer to their story to score political points. Shawn Henry, the other House witness from CrowdStrike scheduled to testify on March 20 before House Intelligence, said on his LinkedIn page that he also works for NBC News, where he says his role is to “advise NBC News on all aspects of national, homeland, and cyber security, to include   appearances on all NBC, MSNBC, and CNBC News programs. ” He added that he is to “regularly appear on Nightly News, The Today Show, and MSNBC news programming. ” CrowdStrike also has a financial connection to one of Hillary Clinton and the Democrats’ most   supporters in Silicon Valley: Google. In 2015, CrowdStrike raised $100 million in a new round of financing, according to the New York Times, which reported that “the investment was led by Google Capital, one of the technology giant’s venture capital arms, in its first cybersecurity deal. ” As Breitbart News reported, the WikiLeaks releases showed that Eric Schmidt, executive of Google Capital parent company and financier Alphabet, appeared to be working directly with the Clinton campaign. All of this makes the reliance of the House Committee and the media on CrowdStrike disturbing, but even worse, earlier this year, BuzzFeed reported that the FBI did not examine the servers of the Democratic National Committee but, instead, based their assessment on CrowdStrike’s evaluation: Six months after the FBI first said it was investigating the hack of the Democratic National Committee’s computer network, the bureau has still not requested access to the hacked servers, a DNC spokesman said. No US government entity has run an independent forensic analysis on the system, one US intelligence official told BuzzFeed News.   …     The FBI has instead relied on computer forensics from a   tech security company, CrowdStrike, which first determined in May of last year that the DNC’s servers had been infiltrated by   hackers, the U. S. intelligence official told BuzzFeed News.   …     “CrowdStrike is pretty good. There’s no reason to believe that anything that they have concluded is not accurate,” the intelligence official said, adding they were confident Russia was behind the widespread hacks. Despite that claim by an unnamed intelligence official, there is reason to believe that what CrowdStrike has concluded is not accurate. At this point, however, the House Committee and the American people will not see it. Breitbart News has requested an interview with Dmitri Alperovitch, but at press time there was no response. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence says that initial witness invitation lists “may be expanded or modified as warranted. ” Follow Breitbart News investigative reporter and Citizen Journalism School founder Lee Stranahan on Twitter at @Stranahan."
7941,7941,26677,"EXCLUSIVE: Cartel Smugglers, Migrants Growing More Violent Against Border Patrol Agents",Breitbart,Brandon Darby,5/24/17,2017,5,,"TUCSON, Arizona  —   Sinaloa   smugglers and migrants are growing more violent against U. S. Border Patrol agents in the Tucson sector as penalties for their crimes stiffen. Realizing that being caught now means almost certain prosecution and incarceration, the smugglers and migrants are increasingly becoming violent with Border Patrol agents in remote border regions in efforts to escape and evade justice. [Border Patrol Agent Art Del Cueto, speaking to Breitbart Texas in his role as National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) spokesman, stated, “The smugglers are definitely becoming more violent with our agents. They now try to evade arrest and even use force to get away from us where during the Obama years they would joke with us and not mind being caught. They knew, back then, that they would get away with violating our laws. ”  Agent Del Cueto continued, “We are talking about significant force and violence being used against our agents. Very recently, one smuggler slammed a large rock into the side of an agent’s head. ” The growing violent tendencies are not limited to the cartel’s drug smugglers, according to Agent Del Cueto. “Even the illegal aliens who aren’t smuggling dope are growing more violent as they now face consequences for illegally entering. Before they would be let go the next day or so, now they face incarceration for illegally entering. They are willing to do anything possible to evade us. ” With the increased aggression levels on the part of the foreign nationals, the agents are forced to be on a higher alert level and willing to use higher level of force to defend their lives. Agent Del Cueto stated, “It’s a concern because when we use force we are put under a microscope and everything we do is scrutinized by different investigative bodies. There was a culture of destroying the lives of Border Patrol agents during the past presidential administration and unfortunately, that culture hasn’t yet completely dissipated. ” Though the Sinaloa Cartel or Federation controls the U. S.  border in this sector, the cartel is actually a collective of numerous regional criminal groups that simply operate under the banner of “Sinaloa Cartel. ” The Tucson sector is largely controlled by two of such regional groups, Los Memos and Los Salazar. The groups are engaged in frequent clashes with each other and Los Salazar has begun using armed scouts to enter U. S. territory, according to sources in Border Patrol who asked to remain anonymous. One source told Breitbart Texas, “We have them on video with   but we haven’t caught them. They most likely wouldn’t use them on random U. S. citizens, but have them for rip crews and to prevent Los Memos or U. S. gangs from stealing their drug loads.

[The text of SJR2 says, “The right of an individual to acquire, keep, possess, transport, carry, transfer, and use arms to defend life and liberty and for all other legitimate purposes is fundamental and shall not be infringed upon or denied. ”  The text goes on to say that “mandatory licensing, registration, or special taxation as a condition of the exercise of this right is prohibited, and any other restriction shall be subject to strict scrutiny. ” The Iowa Firearms Coalition (IFC) is asking gun owners to urge their respective lawmakers to support the amendment, as the Iowa constitution currently has no Second Amendment protection clause. IFC said: Other gun owners will try to convince you there’s more important gun legislation to work on but the fact is without a [right to keep and bear arms] provision in the state constitution every single   law in Iowa is in danger of being wiped out by judicial activism or a runaway legislature. Stand Your Ground, Constitutional Carry, your Permit to Carry  —   all   owner legislation requires that citizens have a guaranteed right to keep and bear arms.

7943,7943,26679,Jerry Brown’s AB 109 ’Reform’ Put L.A.’s Most Wanted Back on Streets - Breitbart,Breitbart,Assemblyman Tim Donnelly,5/17/17,2017,5,,"On Monday, an accused cop killer, gang member Michael C. Mejia, reportedly laughed as he was arraigned in court, according to the local ABC News affiliate. [Mejia was once released under AB 109, Gov. Jerry Brown’s signature prison reform, and now stands accused of committing two murders, including the murder of a Whittier police officer in February.  The explosion of violent and serious crimes across Southern California in the past several months  —   some committed by offenders that Brown released from state supervision, promising they were “  “ ” and “ ” —   has sparked a heated discussion about whether or not the controversial “prison reforms” known as AB 109 and Propositions 47 and 57 are responsible for recent deadly assaults on law enforcement officers. Three days after the February 20 murder of Keith Boyer, a   old Whittier Police Officer, the Los Angeles Times Editorial Board wrote a scathing editorial attacking Officer Boyer’s grieving boss, Whittier PD Chief Jeff Piper, for putting the blame on “criminal justice reforms” championed by Gov. Brown and the Times. The board severely chastised Piper for “mischaracterizing” the AB 109, Prop 47 and 57 prison and sentencing reforms in his moment of grief, claiming he “need[s] to be held accountable for false or misleading statements that are calculated to sway opinion on important policy matters, even if those comments come during times of great duress   …     [Chief] Piper misused the occasion of Boyer’s traumatic death to lash out at recent criminal justice reforms. ” No one likes to be wrong  —   and when someone is caught in a lie, they often double down  —   but it’s unfortunate to see a major Los Angeles newspaper engage in a campaign of deliberate distortion. Take Mejia, Boyer’s alleged murderer, whom the Orange County Register reported had been serving time for grand theft auto before he was released from Pelican Bay State Prison in April 2016. According to the Times, Mejia was not the beneficiary of “early release” or “otherwise at large because of some supposed defect in AB 109, the 2011 ‘realignment’ law that assigned more criminal justice responsibilities to counties. ” Michele Hanisee, President of the Association of Los Angeles Deputy District Attorneys, destroyed the Times‘ claim in a single comment. “Under the old system, [Mejia] would not have been out there to kill Officer Boyer.  Simple as that,” she said in a telephone interview Tuesday with Breitbart News. “Under custody of the state parole system,” Hanisee explained, “Mejia would have been thrown back into state prison for a full year for any one of the five  —   yes, count ‘em  —   five violations he committed after being released. ” Tragically, Mejia’s final probation violation occurred on February 2nd, 2017  —   only 18 days before Officer Boyer’s murder. If only AB 109 had not restricted law enforcement from sending Mejia back behind bars for a longer period of time than 10 days for his repeated violations, Officer Boyer might be alive today. Instead, thanks to Jerry Brown’s AB 109 “reform,” Mejia was only required to report to Los Angeles County Probation, under the   program known as “Post Release Community Supervision (PRCS)” —  and under AB 109, probation violations are limited to a   maximum “flash incarceration. ” Hanisee recently condemned AB 109 in the harshest possible terms on 790 KABC’s McIntyre in the Morning Show, according to a local affiliate of ABC in Los Angeles (KABC 7). “‘If you open these profiles and read them, every time it says, ‘this individual was qualified to be released to the supervision of parole under AB 109 because their current commitment offense is defined as    . ’” She says AB 109, like Propositions 47 and 57, was sold to the public by the politicians. “And they also give them really catchy names like ‘Public Safety Realignment Act’ rather than ‘Transfer Dangerous Felons to Your Jurisdiction Supervision Act. ’” Hanisee says AB 109 continues to threaten public safety, citing the descriptions of the 120 persons currently on the “L. A.’s Most Wanted. ” “It’s horrifying, absolutely horrifying. ” And the result for L. A. and the state? “This is a great place to commit crime. You’re going to get off easy and you’re going to get out early if you go in. ” Tim Donnelly is a former California State Assemblyman and author who is doing a book tour for his new book: Patriot Not Politician: Win or Go Homeless.

In so doing, they fail to note that everyone in Pulse was disarmed it was a   zone.

And all the information includes the fact that Orlando Pulse had a ban on guns, period. t was actually an illustration of the failure of gun bans, rather than justification for implementing them.  It was actually an illustration of the failure of gun bans, rather than justification for implementing them.

Following the horrific Orlando Pulse attack, Gwendolyn Patton, spokesperson for the LGBT gun rights group Pink Pistols, warned people not to be fooled into blaming guns for the attack. Patton stressed: Let us not reach for the   fruit of blaming the killer’s guns. Let us stay focused on the fact that someone hated gay people so much they were ready to kill or injure so many. A human being did this. The human being’s tools are unimportant when compared to the bleakness of that person’s soul. Patton also pointed out that one of the viable responses to the attack is to keep a gun close for   not to disarm. In fact, less than a month before the attack on   Orlando Pulse, the Pink Pistols announced, “We teach queers to shoot. Then we teach others that we have done so.

Partial transcript as follows: SCARBOROUGH: As it was when my hero  —   my political hero was appointed attorney general for his brother, and Republicans didn’t like that back then. I think if you looked at Bobby Kenendy’s record, some good things came out of that. And no  —   BRZEZINSKI: So you’re comparing Ivanka Trump to Bobby Kennedy?

No, I am not saying Jared and Ivanka are Bobby Kennedy. Bobby Kennedy did a lot of things before he became attorney general of the United States of America.

[In a stunning upset, the   jury led by Spanish director Pedro Almodovar and including Hollywood stars Jessica Chastain and Will Smith awarded the trophy to the movie’s director, Ruben Ostlund.  “Oh my God, oh my God!” Ostlund shouted from the stage after besting a raft of favourites for one of global cinema’s most coveted honours. In a 70th anniversary edition marked by raging debate over sexism in the movie industry, Sofia Coppola became only the second woman in history to win best director for her     thriller “The Beguiled” with Nicole Kidman and Colin Farrell. Kidman, who appeared in four different projects at the festival, accepted a special 70th anniversary award from the jury. Diane Kruger clinched best actress for her first film role in her native German as a devastated mother who has lost her family in a Hamburg terror attack, in Fatih Akin’s “In the Fade”. “I cannot accept this award without thinking of everyone who has been touched by an act of terrorism  …     you have not been forgotten,” the clearly moved actress said.   Oscar nominee Joaquin Phoenix nabbed best actor for his turn as a   hitman in the ultraviolent thriller “You Were Never Really Here”. “Any work that I did was linked to the work of Lynne Ramsay,” the film’s British director, Phoenix said, before apologising for his    look at the gala ceremony. “I don’t wear leather,” the committed vegetarian explained.  —   ‘So much courage’  —   Greece’s Yorgos Lantimos shared the best screenplay award with Ramsay for “The Killing of a Sacred Deer” an icy thriller set in a wealthy American suburb and starring Kidman and Farrell. The   Grand Prix went to moving French drama “120 Beats Per Minute” about the radical activists who helped shame the world into action on AIDS. “This film is an homage to those who died but also those who survived and are still alive, who had so much courage,” said the movie’s director, former ACT UP member Robin Campillo. Campillo also wrote the screenplay for “The Class” a drama about a multicultural Paris high school that scooped the Palme d’Or in 2008 as well as an Oscar nomination. “Loveless” by Andrey Zvyagintsev, a wrenching drama about moral rot eating away at Russian society under Vladimir Putin, took the third place jury prize.  —   Magic of big screen  —   “The Square” coming in at two hours and 20 minutes, is an often hilarious art world satire exploring creative liberty, free speech and the blurred lines between the sexes. Danish actor Claes Bang plays a museum director and divorced father of two young daughters who finds himself in an increasingly absurd set of predicaments. The movie features Elisabeth Moss (“Mad Men”) and Dominic West (“The Wire”) in small roles viciously lampooning the   art world. One   featuring a wild,   man performing as an ape wreaking havoc at a posh gala dinner entered festival legend. Cannes’ 12 days of screenings and   soirees  —   which were somewhat muted by the Manchester bombing  —   were marked by unprecedented   measures and a raging row over how technology is shaping the future of the movie industry. Netflix had two movies in competition for the first time but faced blowback from critics who argue that online streaming is destroying cinema distribution and with it the magic of the   experience."
7950,7950,26686,Former Iranian President Rafsanjani Dies,Breitbart,Breitbart Jerusalem,1/8/17,2017,1,,"(AP) Former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a wily political survivor and multimillionaire mogul who remained among the ruling elite despite moderate views, died Sunday, state TV reported. He was 82. [Iranian media reported earlier Sunday that he was taken to a hospital north of Tehran because of a heart condition. State television broke into programming to announce his death.  Rafsanjani’s mix of sly wit and reputation for cunning moves  —   both in politics and business  —   earned him a host of nicknames such as Akbar Shah, or Great King, during a life that touched every major event in Iranian affairs since before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. His presence  —   whether directly or through back channels  —   was felt in many forms. He was a steady leader in Iran’s turbulent years after overthrowing the U. S.  shah, a veteran warrior in the country’s internal political battles and a covert   in intrigue such as the   arms deals in the 1980s. He also was handed an unexpected political resurgence in his later years. The surprise presidential election in 2013 of Rafsanjani’s political soul mate, Hassan Rouhani, gave the former president an insider role in   efforts that included Rouhani’s push for direct nuclear talks with Washington. Rouhani’s victory was also another example of Rafsanjani’s remarkable political luck. Rafsanjani was blocked from the ballot by Iran’s election overseers  —   presumably worried about boosting his already   influence. But, in the end, many liberals turned to Rouhani as an indirect vote for Rafsanjani. It came after years of dwindling influence. Another presidential comeback bid was snuffed out by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s surprise victory in 2005 elections, which left Rafsanjani and his powerful clan as fierce critics of Ahmadinejad."
7951,7951,26687,Shots Fired at Climate Skeptic’s Office During March for Science - Breitbart,Breitbart,James Delingpole,4/24/17,2017,4,,"A leading skeptical scientist has reported that seven shots were fired at his workplace during the weekend’s Earth Day and March for Science events  —   likely as a threat and warning. [Dr Roy Spencer, meteorologist and noted climate skeptic at the University of Huntsville, Alabama, reports at his website that the shots were aimed at the office of his colleague and fellow sceptic, Dr John Christy:  A total of seven shots were fired into our National Space Science and Technology Center (NSSTC) building here at UAH over the weekend. All bullets hit the 4th floor, which is where John Christy’s office is (my office is in another part of the building). Given that this was Earth Day weekend, with a March for Science passing right past our building on Saturday afternoon, I think this is more than coincidence. When some people cannot argue facts, they resort to violence to get their way. It doesn’t matter that we don’t “deny global warming” the fact we disagree with its seriousness and the level of human involvement in warming is enough to send some radicals into a tizzy. Our street is fairly quiet, so I doubt the shots were fired during Saturday’s march here. It was probably late night Saturday or Sunday for the shooter to have a chance of being unnoticed. Maybe the “March For Science” should have been called the “March To Silence”. Campus and city police say they believe the shots were fired from a passing car, based upon the angle of entry into one of the offices. Shell casings were recovered outside. The closest distance a passing car would have been is 70 yards away. Both Spencer and Christy have long incurred the wrath of climate alarmists for the work they do debunking the junk science behind the global warming scare. What they have shown is that the “global warming” recorded by accurate satellite measurements is considerably less dramatic than that shown on the heavily adjusted earth surface temperature datasets preferred by climate alarmists. Christy has made himself especially unpopular by testifying in Congress last month that the climate establishment is corrupt and untrustworthy and that a Red Team needs to be created to correct false “Consensus Science. ” He told Congress: I’ve often stated that climate science is a “murky” science. We do not have laboratory methods of testing our hypotheses as many other sciences do. As a result what passes for science includes, opinion,    dramatic press releases, and fuzzynotions of consensus generated by preselected groups. This is not science. I noticed the House passed an amendment last year to   the U. N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC.) We know from Climategate emails and many other sources that the IPCC has had problems with those who take different positions on climate change than what the IPCC promotes. There is another way to deal with this however. Since the IPCC activity is funded by US taxpayers, then I propose that five to ten percent of the funds be allocated to a group of   scientists to produce an assessment that expresses legitimate, alternative hypotheses that have been (in their view) marginalized, misrepresented or ignored in previous IPCC reports (and thus EPA and National Climate Assessments). Such activities are often called “Red Team” reports and are widely used in government and industry. This is not, it would appear, a message that those in the Climate Change industry  —   sometimes known as the Climate Industrial Complex or the Green Blob  —  want to hear. Especially not the more extreme elements, it seems."

First of all, the change  —   voted on by Republicans on Monday as part of their larger rules package  —   has nothing to do with Trump. The House sets its own rules, and it would actually be an encroachment on the separation of powers for Trump to tell it to do otherwise. Furthermore, Republicans have been in control of the House since 2011 and have left the OCE alone. What Republicans actually did was address two lingering criticisms of the OCE, which was created by Pelosi’s Democrats after they took the House in 2006 (and before she undermined her own promises to “drain the swamp” by taking advantage of her position to buy Visa stock, while softening regulation on credit card companies). The first criticism of the OCE is that it was too frequently confused with the House Ethics Committee, to which the OCE would refer complaints for further inquiry. The second, related complaint is that leaks from the OCE, or statements about its investigations, tarnished the reputations of those it was investigating. Those initiating the investigation could remain anonymous, meaning that it was possible, at least theoretically, for entirely facetious charges to be made against a political target without any opportunity for the accused to question their accusers. (Supporters of the OCE said that flaw was a necessary evil to toughen oversight on Capitol Hill.) The new rules approved Monday change the name of the OCE to the “Office of Congressional Complaint Review,” to clarify it does not have the same status of the House Ethics Committee. In addition, NPR notes, the rules “prevent [OCE] staff from making public statements independent of the House Ethics Committee and prevents it from investigating anonymous tips. ” NPR argues  —   in a news story  —   that the changes “weaken” the OCE. Rep. Bob Goodlatte says the changes “strengthen” it. For his part, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan disagreed with the way the new changes have taken place  —   i. e. outside of a bipartisan process  —   rather than the substance of the changes. But regardless, the changes do not “eliminate” the OCE, nor do they “gut” it. Moreover, criticism of the OCE has been bipartisan (though the case against it has not been  ). What is not bipartisan is the media’s “fake news” approach to the rule changes, which is both exaggerated and  . Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

[Authorities revealed last week in Miami federal court an ongoing investigation into a possible $15, 000 drug deal between suspected drug dealer Harrison Garcia and Brown. Garcia, a    music producer, reportedly confessed last October to selling Lil Wayne  —   real name Dwayne Michael Carter  —   “a lot of narcotics,” the Miami Herald reports.  Garcia reportedly boasted on social media about selling marijuana, “lean,” (Promethazine mixed with Codeine cough syrup) and Xanax, to the   superstars. The Miami Herald reports: Then jurors got to see evidence of Lil Wayne  —   whose real name is Dwayne Michael Carter  —   and Brown’s involvement in the form of text messages seized from Garcia’s phones. The messages appeared to show Garcia directing his “ ” to deliver drugs to Lil Wayne and his crew. “I’ll shoot u some trees,” one message read, a reference to marijuana. “It’s for Wayne,” Garcia allegedly responded via text. The text message about Brown was more explicit. Garcia sent a bragging text message to a woman of a screen shot of the $15, 000 bank deposit from “Christopher Brown” into his account. “Look who put money my account,” Garcia wrote. The woman responded: “What that for LOL” Garcia replied with several smiley face emojis: “Drugs   …     lean and shit. ” Investigators presented the court with dozens of pieces of evidence, some seized from one of Garcia’s homes, as proof of his close connection to Brown and the material benefits of their lavish lifestyle. Federal lawyers showed photos from Garcia’s Instagram account  —   user name muhammad_a_lean  —   that show he and Brown   across the globe. Garcia’s lawyers, Gustavo Lage and Percy Martinez, argued that their client is not a drug dealer and that he simply leveraged his friendship with the Grammy   artists to boost his own industry profile. A jury verdict is expected Monday on the five federal charges Garcia is accused of. If convicted, he could receive up to life in prison.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson"

Ted Cruz ( ) reminded the Democrats, who one after another criticized the nominee, that during his confirmation hearing a decade ago for the federal seat he holds now, not one Democrat  —   including Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama  —   voted against Gorsuch. [“A decade ago, Judge Gorsuch was confirmed by this committee for the Federal Court of Appeals by a voice vote,” Cruz said. “He was likewise confirmed by the entire United States Senate by a voice vote without a single Democrat speaking a word of opposition.  “Not a word of opposition from Minority Leader Chuck Schumer,” Cruz said. “Not from Harry Reid, or Ted Kennedy, or John Kerry. ” “Not from Senators Feinstein, Leahey, or Durbin, who still sit on this committee,” Cruz said. “Not even from Senators Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, or Joe Biden. ” “Not a one of them spoke a word against Judge Gorsuch’s nomination a decade ago,” Cruz said. Cruz said that not only did President Donald Trump play an unprecedented role in the selection of a justice to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia by telling the American people of the 21 people  —   including Gorsuch  —   who would be under consideration if he were elected president, but the voters weighed in. Thus, Gorsuch was “no ordinary nominee,” Cruz said. “His nomination carries with it a super legitimacy that is also unprecedented in our nation’s history,” Cruz said. “The American people played a very direct role in helping choose this nominee. ” Cruz also noted that since Democrats voted for Gorsuch’s federal judgeship 10 years ago, his outstanding record since then should make confirming him even easier. Notwithstanding its leftist political leanings, the American Bar Association (ABA) earlier this month gave Gorsuch a “well qualified” rating to serve as a justice on the U. S. Supreme Court. The ABA has three ratings for judicial nominees: not qualified, qualified, and well qualified. The ABA’s standing committee on the federal judiciary was unanimous in granting Gorsuch its highest rating."

Lauderdale Terrorist Says He Carried Out Attack for Islamic State,Breitbart,Edwin Mora,1/17/17,2017,1,,"Esteban Santiago Ruiz told the FBI that he carried out an attack on Fort Lauderdale on behalf of the Islamic State ( ) Michael Ferlazzo, an FBI special agent, reportedly testified at the attacker’s bond hearing Tuesday. [Santiago is the New   Iraq war veteran of Puerto Rican descent who killed five people and wounded six others at Fort   International Airport in Florida earlier this month.  Citing public records opened last week, Sunshine State News adds that Santiago converted to Islam and created a “jihadist identity” for himself, assuming the Islamic name Aashiq Hammad, prior to joining the U. S. Army. He reportedly downloaded Islamic terrorist propaganda and recorded Muslim religious music online. However, the Miami Herald, citing unnamed law enforcement sources, reported that despite rumors to the contrary, nothing in Santiago’s social media history suggests he was “an Islamic convert inspired by terrorist organizations. ” On Tuesday, the attacker was ordered held without bond. CNN notes that FBI agency Ferlazzo “did not elaborate on whether Santiago was purporting to be linked to ISIS or simply inspired by the terrorist organization. ” ISIS has not claimed responsibility for the attack. Nevertheless, Ferlazzo revealed that, during the   interview conducted after the attack, Santiago claimed “to be fighting for ISIS and that he’d been in touch with   people via jihadi chat rooms who were planning attacks as well,” reports CNN. Moreover, the “FBI agent confirmed that the 9 mm gun used in the Jan. 6 shooting rampage at Fort   International Airport is the same weapon Anchorage, Alaska, police seized and later returned to    Esteban Santiago last year,” reports CBS News. “The agent also testified that Santiago mentioned after the shooting that he was under government mind control. ” The terrorist has already been charged with using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a violent crime performing a violent act against a person at an airport serving international civil aviation that caused serious bodily injury and killing a person with a firearm. Of the charges, the latter two are punishable by death, while the first charge carries a maximum penalty of life behind bars. Santiago revealed before the attack that he was hearing voices and that the CIA had been controlling his mind, federal authorities and the killer’s brother Bryan Santiago have revealed. Nearly a month prior to the attack, Esteban Santiago specifically confessed to the FBI in Alaska where he was living at the time, that he was suffering from government mind control linked to ISIS videos. The FBI reportedly contacted law enforcement in Anchorage and told them the veteran had been having “terroristic thoughts” and believed he was being influenced by ISIS. Although authorities did take Santiago to a mental facility, he was ultimately released along with his weapon. Santiago has confessed to the mass shooting. “At Tuesday’s hearing, the defense did not argue the prosecution’s assertion that Santiago posed a flight risk, as well as a danger to the community, and said that the defendant was prepared to be detained throughout his trial,” reports CNN. “The judge ruled he be held without bond. His next court appearance is January 30. ”"

[The Syrian Foreign Ministry condemned the missile attack in two letters to the UN   and the president of the UN Security Council, saying such an attack would not have occurred had it not been for the “direct support from the outgoing American administration and French and British leaderships. ”  The ministry said the Israeli assault on the Mezzeh military airport comes as part of a series of periodic Israel attacks that started with Syria’s war in March 2011. It called on the international community to “punish the Israeli aggressor. ” The attack was the third such incident recently, according to the Syrian government. In a statement carried on the official news agency SANA, the Syrian military said several missiles were launched just after midnight from an area near Lake Tiberias. The missiles fell in the vicinity of the Mezzeh military airport on the western edge of the Syrian capital. The statement did not say whether there were any casualties. Residents of Damascus reported hearing several explosions that shook the city. The Mezzeh airport compound, located on the southwestern edge of the capital, had been used to launch attacks on   areas near Damascus and has previously come under rebel fire. The Syrian army said Israel, through its attacks, was assisting “terrorist groups” fighting the Syrian government. “The Syrian army command and armed forces warn the Israeli enemy of the repercussions of this blatant attack and stress that it will continue its war on terrorism,” the statement said. On Dec. 7, the Syrian government reported Israel fired    missiles that also struck near the Mezzeh airport. A week earlier, SANA said Israeli jets fired two missiles from Lebanese airspace toward the outskirts of Damascus, in the Sabboura area. The Israeli military has declined to comment on those incidents, and there was no immediate comment on Friday’s reported attack. Israel is widely believed to have carried out a number of airstrikes in Syria in the past few years that have targeted advanced weapons systems, including     missiles and   missiles, as well as positions of the Lebanese militant Hezbollah group in Syria. The Shiite group has sent thousands of its fighters to Syria to support President Bashar Assad’s forces in the country’s civil war, now in its sixth year. Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman recently reiterated his government’s position to not get involved in the Syrian war."

Health care and mining saw jobs gains. [Economists had expected nonfarm payrolls to grow by 145, 000 with an unemployment rate of 4. 4 percent.  The number of unemployed at 6. 9 million and the unemployment rate of 4. 3 percent were nearly unchanged from the prior month. Since January, the unemployment rate has fallen by a half a percentage point and the number of unemployed has declined by 774, 000.  Labor force participation declined   of a percent to 62. 7 percent, near the lowest levels since the 1970s. The unemployment rate for whites declined slightly to 3. 7 percent in May. The jobless rate for Asians was 3. 6 percent, for Hispanics 5. 2 percent and for blacks 7. 5 percent. Payrolls grew in health care and mining. Health care added 24, 000 jobs, while mining jobs grew by 7, 000. Employment in restaurants and bars grew by 38, 000. (Amusing aside: the Bureau of Labor Statistics calls bars “drinking places” in its official releases.) Part time jobs grew by 113, 000, while full time jobs fell by 367, 000.

7963,7963,26699,Chicago Paper: Make All Universities ’Sanctuary Campuses’,Breitbart,John Binder,1/2/17,2017,1,,"The Chicago   editorial board is now asking that every college and university in the state be transformed into ‘sanctuary campuses’ for shielding illegal immigrants from federal law. [In a piece, “Make colleges a sanctuary from deportation threat,” asks that every college and university in Illinois risk losing federal funding for the cause:  Universities have an obligation to stand up for their students  —   all of them. Almost all of these young people on college campuses who fear deportation were brought to this country as babies or small children. They are Americans in every way except for that official citizenship paper. They are the   Dreamers. This is their home, the only one they have ever known. To our thinking, all Illinois universities and colleges, public and private, should declare themselves places of sanctuary, just as cities such as Chicago and New York and counties such as Cook have done. They would send a signal to Trump, who campaigned on an indiscriminate promise to get tough on undocumented immigrants, that Americans are better than that  —   at least when it comes to Dreamers. The Times cited “  on immigration” who have been   Donald Trump’s leading advisors on the issue  —   Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, and former Breitbart Executive Chairman Steve Bannon  —   that could become a detriment to individuals living in the country illegally. The Times’ editors also go on to make a   accusation against the forthcoming Trump administration, claiming that international students are also under threat: And it’s not just undocumented immigrants who are afraid. International students from the Middle East worry Trump’s administration will make it more difficult for them to continue studying in the U. S. They, too, want to know universities’ administrations will advocate for them. Schools should spell out policies and protections, stating them clearly to students, campus police, faculty and staff. It’s not asking too much. Trump’s longtime solution for the illegal immigration issue has been to deport criminal illegal aliens first, then focus on enforcing   so that remaining migrants must return through the country’s naturalization process. The Times thinks otherwise, requesting that illegal immigrants be allowed to not only stay in the country, but they should be given ‘sanctuary’ on every university campus in the state: Whether or not administrators label a university a “sanctuary” campus is not the central issue here. The word is largely symbolic. The American Council on Education points out that it has no clear meaning. Policy is what counts. “Sanctuary” has become an incendiary term that riles some conservatives. Sanctuary cities and counties across America have incurred the wrath of Republicans in Congress. Part of Trump’s   action plan is to eliminate all federal funding to sanctuary cities. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has vowed that Chicago will continue to be a sanctuary city despite Trump’s promise. Other cities also are refusing to back down. Universities and colleges implementing sanctuary campus policies do so at the risk of being stripped of federal funds once Trump’s administration takes control of the matter. Most recently, students at Southern Illinois University (SIU) have demanded that all illegal immigrants residing in the region be given “sanctuary” status on the campus, as Breitbart Texas reported. Students with the Graduate and Professional Student Council and the Undergraduate Student Government are demanding that university officials “begin immediately” crafting a campus policy that would offer comprehensive sanctuary to the Illinois illegal immigrant population from federal immigration laws.

[Kristin Gunckel, a professor at the University of Arizona, argued on behalf of introducing “queer theory” into American elementary school curriculum in a recent lecture that took place last month.  “Queer theory,” according to Gunckel, examines why heterosexuality is portrayed as the “only normal and natural form” for human beings. “It challenges categorical thinking and specifically aims to disrupt the   binary,” she wrote. “Queer theory examines how the social construction of sexuality is normalized so that heterosexuality is portrayed as the only normal and natural form of being human. ” “Queering science education means exploding binary gender and sexuality constructions, collapsing heteronormativity, and opening spaces within science education for the marginalized identities,” she adds. Heteronormativity is defined as “denoting or relating to a world view that promotes heterosexuality as the normal or preferred sexual orientation. In an academic research paper, Gunckel wrote that “school science plays a strong role in silencing queer identities and limiting science knowledge and learning. ” “In elementary school, it means not hiding sexuality from children. At all levels, it means providing space within the curriculum for students to see themselves and their families. Queering science education means making the invisible visible,” Gunckel wrote.

[As reported by the UK Independent:  The South African man and his Ukranian fiancee were reportedly arrested after a doctor in Abu Dhabi who treated Ms Nohai for stomach cramps discovered she was pregnant. Emlyn Culverwell‚ 29, and Iryna Nohai, 27, have not yet been charged by authorities in the Islamic country, who are reportedly still investigating. South Africa’s foreign ministry said it was unable to help the couple as it is a matter of domestic UAE law, the South African News24 website reports. Mr Culverwell’s mother, Linda, said she was unable to get any answers from either the authorities in Abu Dhabi, the South African Embassy in the UAE or the South African consulate there. The company Culverwell works for informed his family that Nohai would have to undergo further testing before charges were filed, to determine precisely how long she has been sexually active. This prompted Culverwell’s mother to exclaim, “For heaven’s sake, how can they supposedly determine that?” The Independent explains that all sex outside marriage is technically illegal in the UAE, but normally the law is not vigorously enforced against Western couples who live together. Such couples do, however, run into trouble if an unmarried woman gives birth, or even if a married woman has a baby that appears to have been conceived before the date on her marriage certificate. Unmarried sex is considered adultery in the Emirates and carries a penalty of at least one year in prison. Custody of children can be removed from women found to have engaged in adulterous relationships. In one of the more notorious cases, a British woman who reported she had been raped by two men in Dubai was charged with illegal extramarital sex, but the charges were dropped after an international outcry. A 2015 report by the BBC found that hundreds of women are imprisoned in the UAE after being accused of extramarital sex, including migrant workers who have been sexually abused. Some of them were sentenced to flogging as well as prison time, although the BBC found no evidence that the floggings were actually carried out."

[The group, the Associated Students of Madison, demanded that the school offer free tuition, free living expenses, and cancel all fees for all African American students as a form of “reparations” for the practice of slavery that ended 150 years ago, Fox News reported.  “The university’s rhetoric suggests that it is committed to diversity and inclusion, so this legislation compels the university to move towards action  —   which is imperative,” said the resolution’s author, ASM Student Council Rep. Tyriek Mack. “If no one challenges the university’s empty promises, then the racial composition will remain stagnant. ” Calling it the “Cognitive Dissonance Resolution,” the ASM policy proposal demands free tuition for all black people, including formerly incarcerated criminals. Free tuition, free housing, and no fees would save a black student up to $20, 000 a year. The resolution also demands that universities spend ten percent of their donations on financial aid. Another provision called on the school to weigh admittance by geographical regions, instead of grades. While black students make up only two percent of the student body, University spokeswoman Meredith McGlone insisted that the proportion of students of color has grown from 11 to 15 percent under current administration policies, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. On the other hand, the State of Wisconsin itself is only six percent black, while the U. S. population is 12 percent black. In the end, McGlone said that some of the things the student group wants are not even legal. “It’s unclear that the methods that they’re suggesting are either legal or the best approach to accomplishing those goals,” McGlone said.

7971,7971,26707,Fake News: CNN’s Zucker Claims Network’s Credibility ’Higher Than Ever’ - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ben Kew,1/18/17,2017,1,,"In an interview with Gabriel Sherman at New York Magazine, CNN President Jeff Zucker claimed that his network’s credibility is “higher than ever” at a time when it is under fire for partisan and dishonest reporting, adding that it would be a “mistake” for the incoming Trump administration to have an adversarial relationship with CNN. [Asked whether he was concerned about the network’s ongoing access to Donald Trump and the new administration, Zucker said it “doesn’t worry [him] that Donald Trump has not done an interview with the network in eight months. ”  “I think our credibility is higher than ever, and our viewership is higher than ever, and our reporting is as strong as ever,” he continued. “The perception of Donald Trump in capitals around the world is shaped, in many ways, by CNN. Continuing to have an adversarial relationship with that network is a mistake,” he continued. Zucker’s comments come at a time when his network’s credibility is under intense scrutiny. Last week, CNN was at the centre of a fake news controversy after it reported on an unverified document, originally published by BuzzFeed, suggesting that Donald Trump had deep ties to the Russian government. At his first press conference since his election, Trump refused to take a question from a CNN reporter, saying that his network had been propagating “fake news. ” In the runup to November’s presidential election, information released by Wikileaks showed the network consistently attempting to help Hillary Clinton’s failed presidential campaign. Examples of this included the network asking senior Democrats to draft questions for interviews with Republican candidates, as well as evidence that DNC Chair Donna Brazile received questions prior to a Democratic primary debate, which she subsequently fed to Hillary Clinton.

7973,7973,26709,O’Donnell: Hillbilly Justice -- How the Battle of Kings Mountain Changed the Course of the Revolution,Breitbart,Patrick O'Donnell,3/24/17,2017,3,,"In the fall of 1780, it looked like the Patriots had all but lost the American Revolution. [The British seemed unstoppable. Back in May, an army led by Henry Clinton and Charles, Earl Cornwallis had conquered Charleston and captured over 5, 000 American soldiers and sailors  —   the largest haul of American prisoners in the entire war. Then in August they destroyed the “Grand” Army led by General Horatio “Granny” Gates at the Battle of Camden. The Crown was on a roll. The string of Patriot defeats led to the serious possibility that France would recall its troops and end its crucial funding of the war. Even Russia meddled in our affairs, and, along with Austria, proposed a peace conference to find a “political solution” to hostilities.  “Reconciliationists” in Congress had begun calling for talks with Great Britain. Loyalists, in America during the eighteenth century, turned out in droves to support the British. American morale plummeted to a new low, and many believed the war would come to an end with some sort of accommodation rather than complete independence. British victory seemed certain. But a certain group of Americans from Appalachia weren’t having it. On a cold day in October 1780, they took matters into their own hands on Kings Mountain in South Carolina. Listen to Patrick K. O’Donnell discuss this on Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM: The story of their epic fight is recounted in Washington’s Immortals, a bestselling book released in paperback this week. The first    treatment of the Revolution, it captures key events of the war from the point of view of Washington’s elite fighters. Pundits say that our country is divided today, but it’s nothing compared to the deep hatred that burned in South Carolina’s Loyalists during the Revolution. In many ways, it was the nation’s first civil war. Bitter violence, including hangings and burnings, became common. The string of British victories had emboldened those on the Loyalist side, and confident of success, they flocked to sign up for the Tory militia. Many of them joined a unit led by   Lt. Col. Patrick Ferguson. At the time, Cornwallis believed that   coming across the border from Northern Carolina were causing much of the violence in South Carolina. He planned to march from Camden, South Carolina, to Charlotte, North Carolina with an army of 2, 200 men, stamping out insurgents along the way. Ferguson and his Loyalist militia played a key role in the attack, forming the left wing of the invasion. Feeling confident in victory, Ferguson boldly proclaimed, “If they [the Patriots] do not desist from their opposition to the British arms, we would march over the mountains, hang their leaders, and lay their country waste with fire and sword. ” He also appealed to the Loyalists of North Carolina, issuing a call to arms: Gentlemen: unless you wish to be eat up by an inundation of barbarians, who have begun by murdering an unarmed son before his aged father, and afterwards lopped off his arms, and who by their shocking cruelties and irregularities, give the best proof of their cowardice and want of discipline I say, if you wish to be pinioned, robbed, and murdered, and see your wives and daughters, in four days, abused by the dregs of mankind —  in short, if you wish or deserve to live, and bear the name of men, grasp your arms in a moment and run to camp. . . . If you choose to be pissed upon by a set of mongrels, say so at once, and let your women turn their backs upon you, and look out for real men to protect them. Ferguson’s words didn’t do much to rally support, but they thoroughly pissed off a group of Americans known as the Overmountain Men. These rugged, independent Americans (today you might call them “hillbillies”) had defied the king and settled beyond the Royal Proclamation Line of 1763, which established everything west of the Appalachian Mountains as Indian territory. Considered illegal squatters, this mixture of Scottish and Irish immigrants (along with a few Germans and Welsh) inhabited what is today the extreme northeast corner of Tennessee. True pioneers, they had been hardened by years of living on the frontier. Every day they fought for their survival against both the elements and the Indians in the area. That hard living had shaped the men’s bodies, making them seem truly intimidating. “[They] appeared like so many devils from the infernal regions, so full of excitement were they as they darted like enraged mountains up the mountain. . . . They were the most   men, [I] ever beheld not overburdened with fat, but tall,   and sinewy with long matted hair —  such men as were never before seen in the Carolinas. ” The Patriots fighting that day included James Potter Collins, a    whose family had been terrorized by Loyalists. He recalled, “I was often employed by the Whig leaders, and particularly by Colonel Moffet to carry and fetch news  —   Confidence was placed in me. I was a good rider, and knew the byways through the woods, by which I was able to elude the vigilance of the Tories, who were always on the watch. ” If the battle went badly, Collins knew he faced very real danger. “It became known to the Tories how I was employed, and a mark was set on me,” he said. “If I had fallen into their hands I have no doubt I should have been killed. ” Despite being only a teenager, Collins was determined to do his part. “Young as I then was, my father thought it prudent that I should enter the service he was in. This service was what was called minute men. We armed ourselves, and generally marched on horseback. We furnished our own equipment: We got swords, butcher knives, and war spurs made by the blacksmiths. ” Ferguson had chosen the position for his men well. They took the high ground on a steep, rugged ridge of Kings Mountain. The Overmountain Men’s only hope of success was to surround them and attack from all sides. But that would expose many of them, particularly those on the left flank, to direct fire from the enemy. It was a perilous operation. The men knew it, and they didn’t care. Collins remembered, “Each leader made a short speech in his own way to his men, desiring every coward to be off immediately here I confess I would willingly have been excused, for my feelings were not the most pleasant. —  this may be attributed to my youth, not being quite seventeen years of age —  but I could not well swallow the appellation of coward. I looked around every man’s countenance seemed to change well, thought I, fate is fate, every man’s fate is before him and he has to run it out. . . . ” The day seemed ominous. “The sky was overcast with clouds, and at times a light mist was falling,” Collins recalled. “Our provisions were scanty and hungry men were like to be fractious each one felt his situation the last stake was up and the severity of the game must be played everything was at stake —  life, liberty, property, and even the fate of wife, children, and friends seemed to depend on the issue: death or victory was the only way to escape suffering. ” Just before they began the assault, this army of   warriors received their general orders: “Fresh prime your guns, and every man go into battle firmly resolving to fight till he dies. ” Using skills honed from their years of hunting and fighting in the woods, about 900 Overmountain Men silently moved toward their positions around the mountain. At the top, 1, 125 men waited for them  —   mostly Loyalists with the only British national being Major Patrick Ferguson. The attack began with   shouts. “The orders were at the firing of the first gun for every man to raise a whoop, rush forward, and fight his way as best he could,” Collins recounted. “We were soon in motion, every man throwing four or five balls in his mouth to prevent thirst —  and also to be in readiness to “reload quick. ” Dodging trees and scrambling over boulders, the Patriots weaved their way up the mountain. Seeing the horde of screaming mountain men charging toward him, Ferguson foolishly ordered his men to form up battle lines rather than entrenching. They began to fire to little avail. Collins recalled, “Their great elevation above us proved their ruin: they overshot us altogether, scarce touching a man except those on horseback, while every rifle from below seemed to have the desired effect. ” Still, the Loyalists managed to repel Collins and his group twice. But as they charged for a third time, the Loyalists’ ranks began to melt away. Atop his white charger, Ferguson frantically rode from one end of the line to the other, waving his sword and encouraging his men to hold. Despite his cries, the Tory militia began to raise white flags and cry for quarter. Sensing victory, the Patriot officers roared, “Hurrah, my brave fellows! Advance!” Bitter from a previous defeat where the British had refused to take prisoners and instead slaughtered the Americans, many of the Overmountain Men chose not to accept the surrender. They continued to fire into the enemy lines. Several of the officers attempted to intercede and, knocking guns upward, shouted, “Don’t shoot! It is murder to kill them now for they have raised the flag! “Cease firing! For God’s sake, cease firing!” Collins recalled the carnage: “The poor Tories appeared to be really pitiful the dead lay in heaps on all sides, and the groans of the wounded were heard in every direction. ” Ferguson himself had also fallen. “It appeared that almost fifty rifles must have leveled at him at the same time seven balls had passed through his body both his arms were broken and his hat and clothing were literally shot to pieces. ” One of his mistresses, a beautiful redhead who had accompanied him to battle, shared his fate. Eventually, the Overmountain Men did stop shooting. According to reports, they captured 698 prisoners after killing 157 and badly wounding 163. The next morning, a Sunday, the families of the dead came to claim the bodies of the fallen. “The scene became really distressing,” Collins recalled. “The wives and children of the poor Tories came in, in great numbers their husbands, fathers, and brothers lay in great heaps while others lay wounded or dying. ” The families quickly buried their loved ones, but not deeply enough to keep them safe from animals. “The hogs in the neighborhood gathered into the place to devour the flesh of men,” Collins said. “Half the dogs in the country were said to be mad and were put to death. ” Weeks later the carnage was still visible as “all parts of the human frame lay scattered in every direction. ” The grisly victory of the Overmountain Men served as a turning point in the South. The colonists now saw the “invincible” British as vulnerable to defeat. British General Henry Clinton summed up the battle: “[Kings Mountain] unhappily proved the first link in the chain of evils that followed each other in regular succession until they at last ended in the total loss of America. ” Grit and resilience, from a very tough core of Americans, changed the course of the Revolution.

[Helen Reynolds was in her apartment in Parkesburg, Pennsylvania Feb. 17 when a man dressed as an apartment complex worker forced his way inside her home and bound her mouth and hands with duct tape, the Daily Mail reported.  “He wrapped it all around my face and my nose and my eye glasses. He had a piece in my mouth,” Reynolds told WPVI. She said he took $40 from her purse and was about to rape her when she struck up a conversation with the man. Despite having duct tape in her mouth, she was able to talk the man out of raping her. “I said to him, ‘Well it’s like this,’” Reynolds recalled. “‘You might as well know the truth.’ I said, ‘I have HIV and my husband died from it,’ which is a lie. ” She said as soon as she told him that he walked out of the bedroom. “That’s the comment that saved my life,” she said.

We’re talking about somebody who is so emasculated by Vladimir Putin  …    that he has to come back and pick on vulnerable kids. ”  Petkanas said, “This is guidance that was provided to schools that schools wanted and asked for, and it is very  —   it’s for a very specific reason, they wanted to create a safe environment for all the kids in their school, and they wanted to avoid Title IX lawsuits. I mean, that’s what’s so   about what the Trump administration did today. He took away practical guidance to school administrators and principals, who were looking to create this safe environment, and were looking to not get sued for Title IX violations. ” He added, “Donald Trump is not only a monster, but he’s a coward. We’re talking about somebody who is so emasculated by Vladimir Putin, that he has to come back  —   no no  —   that he has to come back and pick on vulnerable kids. ” The discussion then turned to the issue of transgenderism writ large. Petkanas stated that “One’s gender identity is enough to show what gender they are. ” Petkanas was asked what would prevent host Tucker Carlson from playing on a women’s sports team, serving a prison sentence in a women’s prison. He responded that there aren’t any examples of anyone doing this.

7978,7978,26714,Cubs’ Jake Arrieta on Nats-Giants Brawl: ‘I Thought it was Awesome’,Breitbart,Dylan Gwinn,5/31/17,2017,5,,"Not everyone thought that the brawl between the Nationals and the Giants, headlined by outfielder Bryce Harper and reliever Hunter Strickland, was necessarily a great look for major league baseball. [But, don’t count Cubs pitcher Jake Arrieta among them.  While appearing on the Bernstein and Goff Show on 670 The Score in Chicago on Tuesday, Arrieta said he felt that the brawl was “awesome” and “refreshing”: I don’t think anybody is right or wrong. I thought it was awesome. Every once in a while, it’s refreshing to see two teams emotionally charged getting after it. And when something like that happens versus continuing to chirp and talk about it, why don’t you go out there and see somebody? That’s exactly what happened in the game yesterday. Bryce and Hunter went out there, they were a few punches, they landed one apiece, I believe. And then Samardzija comes out of left field and smashes into Morse. I’m pretty sure Harper was lucky that they collided, because Samardzija was coming in to do some damage. Arrieta elaborated further: If two guys want to go see each other, let them be in the middle, let them throw some punches, then break it up. I don’t like to see any sucker punches. I do think in the heat of battle if you’re getting hit on the hip with 98, then you should be able to go out and see somebody. I think the umpires handled it well. They let them exchange for a moment, then they tried to break it up. What I don’t like to see is a lot of chirping and guys just talking crap to each other. If you got something wrong with a guy, go see him. And then they’ll break it up and continue to play the game. One of the most interesting aspects of the brawl between the Nats and the Giants was the fact that Giants catcher Buster Posey didn’t try to stop, or interfere with Harper as he ran out to fight his pitcher. Arrieta liked how Posey handled the situation and hoped his catchers would do the same: If it’s my catcher, I want him to wait and give me an opportunity to do a little damage. I don’t want it broken up right away. If it happens, I’ll let you know. I’ll be ready. You know, I like my chances toe to toe with just about anybody. I know Willson (Contreras) would probably beat whoever charges the mound to the mound, but I’ll tell him and Miggy (Montero) ‘Hey, give me 10, 15 seconds to get some work in and then come out and see me.’ Hardball Talk’s Bill Baer took exception to Arrieta’s perspective on the fight: Unfortunately, Arrieta is wrong for championing continued violence in baseball. Eventually, someone is going to be seriously hurt or killed because a baseball man had his feelings hurt. It’s not good for the game, especially if a star like Harper is involved and gets injured either by the pitch or by joining the fracas. It’s not good for kids watching, who learn that violence is an acceptable response to a perceived slight. It’s great for sportswriters, though, who get something to talk about for a couple days. So, uh, thanks, I guess. The only thing at risk of being killed during this brawl was the art of proper punch throwing. The art of throwing a helmet also took a hit, given that Bryce Harper stood directly in front of Strickland and yet, somehow, threw his helmet perpendicular to him. As for “the kids,” baseball has embraced violence as an acceptable response to perceived slights for over a hundred years. If baseball hasn’t ruined the youth of America yet, chances are it won’t.

7979,7979,26715,House Oversight Testimony: ’America Has Spoken-We Want the Wall Built Right Away’ - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ian Mason,4/27/17,2017,4,,"The National Security Subcommittee of the House Oversight Committee held a hearing Thursday on President Donald Trump’s signature election pledge of a wall on the southern border. [Five witnesses, four speaking in favor of the wall’s construction and one against, testified before the Subcommittee.  Subcommittee Chairman Rep. Ron DeSantis ( ) framed the issue before the testimony of the witnesses. “A central issue of the President’s 2016 campaign was the promise to build ‘an impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful southern border wall,’” he said. DeSantis cited Israel’s successful border wall as a model for our own: President Trump has identified Israeli border security measures as a potential model for securing the U. S.  border. The construction of a security fence on the   Border cut illegal entries from over 16, 500 in 2011 to just 43 in 2013 and 12 in 2014  —   a 99 percent decrease. DeSantis also disputed Democrats’ claim that the wall might cost $70 billion, citing the Democrats’ own witness at the hearing, Seth Stodder, an Assistant Secretary in the   as estimating a cost of only $14 billion in January. Mark DeSaulnier, a Democratic Member of the National Security Subcommittee, used part of his opening remarks to play a video featuring Republicans like Sen. John McCain ( ) who never supported President Trump’s plans for a wall, saying they did not think he could get “Mexico to pay for the wall” as he promised on the campaign trail. Maria Espinoza, national director of the Remembrance Project, a   representing the victims of illegal immigrant crime and their families, testified that: Americans will continue to be under assault until the wall is built   …     While it seemed as though the politicians listened and even publicly gave the families their condolences, congressional leadership, the bodies of both houses, Republican and Democrat, have failed to enact the very measures that would have saved American lives. America has spoken. We want the wall built right away   …     those who falsely state that a great border wall would not work either don’t know their history or are in denial. ” Agnes Gibbony, one of Espinoza’s “angel mothers” whose son was murdered by an illegal alien, took over to add her own horrific experience with lax border enforcement to the congressional record. Gibbony’s herself is an immigrant, fleeing to America with her parents in the wake of Nikita Khrushchev’s bloody Soviet intervention in her native Hungary in 1956. Her memory of immigration is a far cry from the lawless chaos on the southern border today. “We followed all the rules, the law. We followed all the background investigation   …     We also had to have character witnesses testify that we had good moral standing and my father was required to have a job contract,” she recalled for the Subcommittee. Gibbony’s  son, Ronald da Silva, was shot to death by an illegal in 2002. She told the Subcommittee: The shooter, the murderer, was an illegal alien with a long criminal record who had been previously deported. Immediately after the shooting, he fled to Mexico. His wife was depositing his welfare check at the credit union so he could live on it. He eventually returned to the United States and was sent to prison. He is due to be released in two years and seven months. I am afraid California will fail to notify ICE of his pending release. Gibbony’s pain, however, will go on longer than Ronald’s killer’s criminal case. “Ronald was my first and my only son,” Gibbony said, “I live a life sentence of pain and suffering, wondering what would Ronald look like. Would he have grey hair at age 44? Would he be married? What would he be doing?” Gibbony drew a direct link for the Members of Congress present from poor border enforcement to her and many other American’s victimization, pointing out that the true toll of illegal alien crime remains poorly documented: I will forever miss all the tomorrow and everything that was taken from me, all because of broken open borders   …     Hundreds of victims, innocent lives. I wonder how many more there are, because our government does not keep statistics on illegal aliens’ crimes. Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security announced the creation of the “Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement” office or VOICE in an effort to better track excess crime from illegal border crossing. Gibbony also called out the culture of giving sympathetic treatment to the illegal alien issue while ignoring people like her, victims of that same unchecked border crossing. “You may say it is inhumane to deport illegal aliens who didn’t care about breaking our laws. How inhumane is it that my son Ronald and thousands of innocent victims’ lives were cut short?” she asked. Steven A. Camarota, Director of Research for the Center for Immigration Studies, a   dedicated to studying the consequences of immigration, laid out the economic case for the wall. He cited dates from a National Academies of Science paper and estimates of illegal alien educational achievement to reach some striking conclusions. “On balance if you take all the taxes that they’re likely to pay over their lifetime, given their education levels, and the services and costs they create, there’s a net drain on tax payers of about $75, 000 per illegal border crosser,” he told the subcommittee. If the illegal aliens’ descendants here in the United States are included, the net burden rises to $94, 000 for each illegal border crosser. “The fiscal cost of illegal immigrants is not due to the fact that they don’t want to work. It’s not even due to the fact that many work off the books. Rather, it reflects their educational attainment,” Camarota noted, “The bottom line is, unskilled immigration, which characterizes most illegal immigrants, is costly to tax payers. ” Camarota told the Subcommittee that the wall stands a good chance of being a net fiscal boon to the United States. “If we were to stop just  % of those crossers in the next decade, it would generate $  billion in savings  …    in effect, the wall could pay for itself even if it only kept out a small fraction of people expected to come,” he testified. Agent Brandon Judd, President of the National Border Patrol Council, added his own practical experience on the border to the mix. “As an agent who worked in two of the busiest sectors in the history of the border patrol, I can personally tell you how effective border barriers are,” he told the Subcommittee. Judd was clear that he does not think it is necessary to build 2, 000 miles of wall across the entire border, but that the effect in certain strategic locations could be substantial. “Border security is not cheap, but the cost of doing nothing is much higher,” he stressed. Judd further testified that the wall is not a “silver bullet” and would have to work in conjunction with other border security measures including staffing up the Border Patrol and cracking down on   “sanctuary” cities. Mr. Stodder, the former Obama administration official opposed to the wall, called it a “massive waste of billions of taxpayer dollars. ” Stodder mocked analyses like Camarota’s, noting that net immigration from Mexico has markedly decreased in recent years, telling the Subcommittee, “The fear that America is somehow being overwhelmed by massive numbers of Mexican economic migrants seeking to cross the Rio Grand to take our jobs   …     [is an] outdated talking point from the 1990s. ” While disapproving of the wall, Stodder agreed that “our immigration system is indeed in crisis. ” But he attributed this to “straining from the flow of Central American asylum seekers. ” According to him: The Wall will not help address the most pressing migration challenge we face, which stems from the crisis in Central America, whereby thousands of Guatemalan, El Salvadoran, and Honduran families (and unaccompanied children) have been fleeing violence, extreme poverty, and environmental crises, and coming to our border to seek asylum here, we need more resources specifically devoted to addressing this challenge   …     suffice it to say, a wall is not going to help. Asked by Chairman DeSantis whether the drop in border crossings referenced by Stodder was related to the new “posture” of the Trump administration, Agent Judd replied, “I know it is. When we interview these individuals who are currently crossing the border, they know that the laws are going to be enforced. ” “But I must warn you,” Judd added, “We’re in a ‘honeymoon period.’ We have to continue to enforce the laws, because if we don’t, illegal immigration is going to go back up. ”"

The press did all that good work ruining its reputation on its own, and we can have a long conversation about what created that. Part of it, though, is  …    a lot of hysterical coverage about every little last thing that doesn’t warrant it. ”  After Hewitt said that the “media handwringing” has gotten to be too much, Dickerson said, “I agree with you, to a point. You’re absolutely right. Focus on the big things. ” He added, “I think that the problem is, the Flynn matter, and, you know, when you have a press conference like yesterday, you would have liked to have heard somebody and somewhere in the Flynn saga say, you know, he had to resign because we don’t lie to the American people, and just make it  —   and that’s never been said. It’s never been said in this whole thing about, you know, this is about giving misinformation to the American people about a not unimportant thing. And the culture of truth telling that should be a part of a White House is not  —   you don’t get that. You know, the President was loose about the Electoral College thing. He said that for months. Nobody stepped in to say, Mr. President, that’s not right. Or they did, and it’s just no big deal. So that’s  —   and why does that matter? You know why it matters, because little shadings end up to be a big shading at the end. ” Dickerson further stated, “My point is, if you’re going to make a case on honesty grounds and truthfulness grounds, if that’s the turf on which you’re going to hold your press conference and open your press conference, so we’re talking about veracity here, and the importance and necessity of that, then when it comes to veracity in your own backyard, to elide it completely, seems inconsistent with the argument that you’re making in the 77 minute press conference. ” Hewitt then stated that people don’t believe the media anymore, to which Dickerson responded, “Well, yes. I mean, yes, it’s true, and it’s not because of anything obviously Donald Trump did. The press did all that good work ruining its reputation on its own, and we can have a long conversation about what created that. Part of it, though, is what you mentioned about the local weather report, which is to say a lot of hysterical coverage about every little last thing that doesn’t warrant it. Having said that, it doesn’t mean, and in fact, it most explicitly does not mean, that the press just throws out the standards.

Pavone tells Breitbart News he is in touch daily with women who mourn their lost motherhood following abortion. ”Our society must not settle for leaving women who face unplanned pregnancy no hope but abortion.” https:  .   —   March for Life (@March_for_Life) May 10, 2017,  “Mother’s Day is for so many of them a time of particular pain, but also a time of particular healing,” he explains. “There are many sentimental trappings of Mother’s Day  —   and these, of course are nothing bad  —   the cards and flowers, the hearts and   greetings. But the woman who started Mother’s Day came to feel that sentimentality had obscured its original meaning. ” Pavone also provides pastoral leadership for the Silent No More Awareness Campaign, an effort to mobilize those who testify to the pain they have experienced through abortion. He relates the story of Anna Jarvis, the founder of the original Mother’s Day holiday, to those who are helping others heal after abortion: After the Civil War, Anna Jarvis, an activist from West Virginia, wanted to honor her late mother for her good work in her lifetime. Anna’s mother had started mothers clubs to help lower infant mortality. Anna carried on her mother’s work. With the outbreak of the Civil War, she created mothers’ clubs that tended to wounded soldiers on both sides. These concrete and organized actions of mothers involved hard work and sustained commitment geared toward saving lives, and often marked by the pain of losing those lives. In a sense, then, the current holocaust of abortion in which we are living, and the pain of so many mothers who have lost their own children, can be an occasion to recover deeper and more original meanings of Mother’s Day. Mothers can come together  —   as so many do through Rachel’s Vineyard and Silent No More  —   to strengthen one another to face the pain abortion brings, to walk the journey of healing, and to commit themselves to save as many lives as possible from this scourge of our day. And in that sense Mother’s Day becomes a holiday for all of us to renew our commitment to defend mothers and their children from something that is taking far more lives than war or disease has ever taken. On Mother’s Day,   leaders also remember women and girls who have continued an unplanned pregnancy and offered their babies for adoption.

7983,7983,26719,United Nations Elects Saudi Arabia to Women’s Rights Commission - Breitbart,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,4/23/17,2017,4,,"The United Nations Economic and Social Council voted late last week to place Saudi Arabia on the Commission on the Status of Women for a   term beginning in 2018, despite that country’s appalling record on the treatment of women. [Hillel Neuer, director of the   UN Watch, expressed his outrage in a statement Friday:  “Electing Saudi Arabia to protect women’s rights is like making an arsonist into the town fire chief,” said Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch. “It’s absurd. ” “Every Saudi woman,” said Neuer, “must have a male guardian who makes all critical decisions on her behalf, controlling a woman’s life from her birth until death. Saudi Arabia also bans women from driving cars. ” According to UN Watch, the United States forced a formal vote, against China’s wishes, instead of allowing the normal practice of allowing regional groupings to select the nations on the commission by themselves, in secret. However, the vote was still held behind closed doors, meaning it is not yet clear precisely which countries voted to honor one of the world’s foremost abusers of women’s rights. Neuer calculates, based on the voting math, that at least five European Union member states would have had to vote for Saudi Arabia for it to win a seat on the commission. The U. S. State Department’s most recent human rights report on Saudi Arabia (largely prepared by the outgoing Obama administration) notes that despite being allowed to participate in municipal elections in 2015, the state of women’s rights in the kingdom remains generally abysmal: Women continued to face significant discrimination under law and custom, and many remained uninformed about their rights.   …     The law does not provide for the same legal status and rights for women as for men, and since there is no codified   law, judges made decisions regarding family matters based on their interpretations of Islamic law. Although they may legally own property and are entitled to financial support from their guardian, women have fewer political or social rights than men, and society treated them as unequal members in the political and social spheres. The guardianship system requires that every woman have a close male relative as her “guardian” with the legal authority to approve her travel outside of the country. A guardian also has authority to approve some types of business licenses and study at a university or college. Women can make their own determinations concerning hospital care. Women can work without their guardian’s permission, but most employers required women to have such permission. A husband who verbally (rather than through a court process) divorces his wife or refuses to sign final divorce papers continues to be her legal guardian. In 2015, Saudi Arabia reduced a Sri Lankan woman’s sentence for adultery from execution by stoning to three years in prison. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

7986,7986,26722,DELINGPOLE: ’Penises Cause Climate Change’ Progressives Fooled by Peer-Reviewed Hoax Study - Breitbart,Breitbart,James Delingpole,5/20/17,2017,5,,"Gender studies is a fake academic industry populated by charlatans, deranged activists and gullible idiots. [Now, a pair of enterprising hoaxers has proved it scientifically by persuading an academic journal to   and publish their paper claiming that the penis is not really a male genital organ but a social construct.  The paper, published by Cogent Social Sciences  —   “a multidisciplinary open access journal offering high quality peer review across the social sciences”  —   also claims that penises are responsible for causing climate change. The two hoaxers are Peter Boghossian, a   faculty member in the Philosophy department at Portland State University, and James Lindsay, who has a doctorate in math and a background in physics. They were hoping to emulate probably the most famous academic hoax in recent years: the Sokal Hoax  —   named after NYU and UCL physics professor Alan Sokal  —   who in 1996 persuaded an academic journal called Social Text to accept a paper titled “Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity”. Sokal’s paper  —   comprising pages of   but meaningless   jargon  —   was written in part to demonstrate that humanities journals will publish pretty much anything so long as it sounds like “proper leftist thought” and partly in order to send up the absurdity of so much   social science. So, for this new spoof, Boghossian and Lindsay were careful to throw in lots of signifier phrases to indicate fashionable   bias: We intended to test the hypothesis that flattery of the academic Left’s moral architecture in general, and of the moral orthodoxy in gender studies in particular, is the overwhelming determiner of publication in an academic journal in the field. That is, we sought to demonstrate that a desire for a certain moral view of the world to be validated could overcome the critical assessment required for legitimate scholarship. Particularly, we suspected that gender studies is crippled academically by an overriding   belief that maleness is the root of all evil. On the evidence, our suspicion was justified. They also took care to make it completely incomprehensible. We didn’t try to make the paper coherent instead, we stuffed it full of jargon (like “discursive” and “isomorphism”) nonsense (like arguing that hypermasculine men are both inside and outside of certain discourses at the same time)   phrases (like “   society”) lewd references to slang terms for the penis, insulting phrasing regarding men (including referring to some men who choose not to have children as being “unable to coerce a mate”) and allusions to rape (we stated that “manspreading,” a complaint levied against men for sitting with their legs spread wide, is “akin to raping the empty space around him”). After completing the paper, we read it carefully to ensure it didn’t say anything meaningful, and as neither one of us could determine what it is actually about, we deemed it a success. Some of it was written with the help of the Postmodern Generator  —   “a website coded in the 1990s by Andrew Bulhak featuring an algorithm, based on NYU physicist Alan Sokal’s method of hoaxing a cultural studies journal called Social Text, that returns a different fake postmodern ‘paper’ every time the page is reloaded. ” This paragraph, for example, looks impressive but is literally meaningless: Inasmuch as masculinity is essentially performative, so too is the conceptual penis. The penis, in the words of Judith Butler, “can only be understood through reference to what is barred from the signifier within the domain of corporeal legibility” (Butler, 1993). The penis should not be understood as an honest expression of the performer’s intent should it be presented in a performance of masculinity or hypermasculinity. Thus, the isomorphism between the conceptual penis and what’s referred to throughout discursive feminist literature as “toxic hypermasculinity,” is one defined upon a vector of male cultural machismo braggadocio, with the conceptual penis playing the roles of subject, object, and verb of action. The result of this trichotomy of roles is to place hypermasculine men both within and outside of competing discourses whose dynamics, as seen via   discourse analysis, enact a systematic interplay of power in which hypermasculine men use the conceptual penis to move themselves from powerless subject positions to powerful ones (confer: Foucault, 1972). None of it should have survived more than a moment’s scrutiny by serious academics. But it was   by two experts in the field who, after suggesting only a few changes, passed it for publication: Cogent Social Sciences eventually accepted “The Conceptual Penis as a Social Construct. ” The reviewers were amazingly encouraging, giving us very high marks in nearly every category. For example, one reviewer graded our thesis statement “sound” and praised it thusly, “It capturs [sic] the issue of hypermasculinity through a   and nonlinear process” (which we take to mean that it wanders aimlessly through many layers of jargon and nonsense). The other reviewer marked the thesis, along with the entire paper, “outstanding” in every applicable category. They didn’t accept the paper outright, however. Cogent Social Sciences’ Reviewer #2 offered us a few relatively easy fixes to make our paper “better. ” We effortlessly completed them in about two hours, putting in a little more nonsense about “manspreading” (which we alleged to be a cause of climate change) and “  contests. ” No claim made in the paper was considered too ludicrous by the  : not even the one claiming that the penis is “the universal performative source of rape, and is the conceptual driver behind much of climate change. ” You read that right. We argued that climate change is “conceptually” caused by penises. How do we defend that assertion? Like this: Destructive, unsustainable hegemonically male approaches to pressing environmental policy and action are the predictable results of a raping of nature by a   mindset. This mindset is best captured by recognizing the role of [sic] the conceptual penis holds over masculine psychology. When it is applied to our natural environment, especially virgin environments that can be cheaply despoiled for their material resources and left dilapidated and diminished when our patriarchal approaches to economic gain have stolen their inherent worth, the extrapolation of the rape culture inherent in the conceptual penis becomes clear. The fact that such complete drivel was published in a social science journal, the hoaxers argue, raises serious questions about the value of fields like gender studies and the state of academic publishing generally: “The Conceptual Penis as a Social Construct” should not have been published on its merits because it was actively written to avoid having any merits whatsoever. The paper is academically worthless nonsense. But they do not hold out much hope for it having any more effect on the bullshit in the social sciences industry than Sokal’s hoax did  —   because leftist stupidity in academe is so heavily entrenched. As a matter of deeper concern, there is unfortunately some reason to believe that our hoax will not break the relevant spell. First, Alan Sokal’s hoax, now more than 20 years old, did not prevent the continuation of bizarre postmodernist “scholarship. ” In particular, it did not lead to a general tightening of standards that would have blocked our own hoax. Second, people rarely give up on their moral attachments and ideological commitments just because they’re shown to be out of alignment with reality."
7987,7987,26723,PBS Islamic Lesson Plan Encourages Students to Identify with Radical Jihadists - Breitbart,Breitbart,Dr. Susan Berry,4/13/17,2017,4,,"A PBS high school lesson plan encourages students to empathize with young Palestinian terrorists who want to become suicide bombers to achieve martyrdom and suggests they would rather die because Palestinians have less land and are restricted. [The “Dying to Be a Martyr” multimedia lesson plan is available free of cost to teachers and students at PBS Learning Media, reports Justin Haskins at the Heartland Institute. It utilizes videos titled “Martyrdom,” “Suicide Bombing,” and “Israel and Palestine,” as well as internet sites and primary sources “to examine the roots of the Middle East conflict. ”  Students are asked to be able to understand “why individuals and groups sometimes turn to tactics of terrorism. ” At first, students are asked to learn about the connections that all three major faiths  —   Judaism, Christianity, and Islam  —   have to Israel. However, later on in the lesson, students view the video “Israel and Palestine,” and are asked to focus on 25   Majdi Amer, who built a bomb in 2003 for a suicide bomber in Haifa who ultimately killed 17 people, and wounded 50 more, on a bus. Students are asked to compare Majdi’s view of suicide bombing with that of    Mohanned Abu Tayyoun, who wavers in carrying out his suicide mission and ultimately goes to jail in Israel. In Part III of the lesson plan, students view an interview with Mohanned in jail and are asked to “identify how Mohanned views his life and how he feels it differs from the lives of Israelis (Jews). ” “Martyrdom leads us to God,” he responds. “I don’t want this life. When you become a martyr, your prize for carrying out the operation is going to heaven  …    We Palestinians prefer to die, just kill ourselves, rather than live this worthless life. Our lives are worthless. We are hollow bodies living a pointless life. ” “Israelis enjoy their life,” Mohanned continues. “They go out at night. They have cafes and nightclubs. They travel all over the world. They go to America and Britain. We can’t even leave Palestine. ” Teachers are asked to check students’ understanding of the reasons Mohanned feels he would rather die and be a martyr than live his life. The lesson suggests that Mohanned may feel that way because “Palestinians have less land, fewer privileges, cannot come and go as they please. ” In Part IV of the lesson plan, Majdi is interviewed in a video and is asked why it is acceptable for him to kill women and children. “If the Israelis kill a child in Gaza, I’m ready to kill one in Tel Aviv,” he says. “If they destroy houses in Gaza, I’ll do it in Tel Aviv. If they give me security in my land, then there’s no problem. ” “No instructions are provided telling teachers to denounce the radical claims made by Majdi, and there are no other lesson plans describing the conflict from the point of view of the Israelis,” observes Haskins. JP Morgan Chase and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting  —   which is funded by the federal government  —   fund the lesson plan’s website. The Christian Action Network (CAN) has filed a demand letter with the U. S. Education Department urging it to stop funding the Islamic lesson plans that are part of a program called “Access Islam. ” “So, PBS Learning Media is one of the websites that is promoting it,” CAN’s president Martin Mawyer recently told Breitbart News. “The Smithsonian also promotes it, the Indiana Department of Education promotes it, and even the United Nations promotes it. ” Mawyer claims that through the Access Islam curriculum, American students are taught the Islamic way of life in a way that crosses the line from academics to indoctrination."

R. 5, Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017, which passed the House Jan. 11,    with five Democrats joining the majority. “The historic election of Donald Trump this November sent a clear message to Washington that the American people don’t want eight more years of the same and Congress owes it to them to deliver on this mandate,” Ratcliffe said. “That’s why  —   right off the bat  —   I reintroduced two key pieces of legislation that will help heal our nation from the damage done by the immense regulatory overreach imposed under President Obama’s watch. ” The ALERT Act blocks bureaucrats from implementing federal regulations without first providing the public with detailed information for at least six months before they go into effect. Under current law, federal agencies are required to release an update twice a year on the regulations being developed by federal agencies —  but, in the Obama administration, many of the updates were late, if ever issued at all. SOPRA takes on one of the most important Supreme Court decisions to buttress the regulatory state, the Chevron decision, the 1984 ruling that created “Chevron Deference,” a   standard by which federal courts are compelled to defer to how a federal agency chooses to interpret a federal regulation. What began in 1984 as a win for President Ronald Reagan, who successfully defended his administration’s interpretation of the Clean Air Act  —   which allowed Chevron to expand a refinery without having to apply for new permits, as if it was a new plant  —   grew into a chèque en blanc for federal regulators throughout the government. The congressman said SOPRA seeks to restore three   branches of government by abolishing the doctrine that has often enabled administrative agencies to interpret laws to mean whatever they want. “Regardless of what my tenure is in Congress, I don’t know how long I’ll be here, but I am confident that the Separation of Powers Restoration Act will be the most important bill that I ever file. ” Ratcliffe said he discussed SOPRA and Chevron Deference with Trump during the campaign, when the two men had a private conversation at an Oct 11 North Dallas fundraiser. “I said: ‘Mr. Trump, when you get elected, I’ve got one bill in particular that I’m anxious to get to your desk, I think you’re really going to like it,” he said. “Then, we talked about it for five minutes. ” In their short conversation before Trump spoke to his supporters at the Lincoln Center Hilton hotel, the congressman said he spelled out how SOPRA would rebalance the relationship between regulators, the courts, and Congress. “He certainly understood the concept and the impact  —   and was not just receptive to it, but said, ‘I’m excited by the opportunity for something like that become law.’ He actually sort of extended the conversation  —   he was very engaged about the the specifics, once mentioned to him  —   he was like, ‘Tell me more,’ but I didn’t take that as a promise or anything” On the campaign trail, the president often spoke about the way American individuals and businesses are being strangled by an expanding federal government, Ratcliffe said. A few days after the election, Speaker Paul Ryan (R. .) reached out to Ratcliffe about SOPRA and getting it to a vote early in the new session.  SOPRA was already a central plank of the speaker’s “Better Way” agenda, and GOP congressmen and candidates campaigned on the issue in their own states. Ratcliffe said a great example of how Trump in the White House changes the dynamics on Capitol Hill is that the same week in the last session that the House passed SOPRA, President Barack Obama issued a veto statement that was enough to wave off the Senate from taking up a bill. The congressman said that with Obama in the White House, so many bills brought up and passed in the House, like the ALERT Act and SOPRA, became what are known on Capitol Hill as “messaging bills. ” These bills are useful for forcing people to go on the record for or against an issue, but everyone knows they will never actually become law. Before the bills sent the message to the voters, “This is what Republicans stand for and what we would do if we had a Republican president  —   well, now, that’s the opportunity at hand,” he said. “Hillary Clinton promised very much the same as President Obama delivered  —    essentially, a third term, so bills like these would very likely has been    in the 115th Congress if she won. ” “Trump winning?” he said. “This is what I mean by the ‘impossible now becomes possible. ’” Now House conservatives have an ally in the White House, he said. “I am so excited about what can be done,” he added. “The fact that there is a willing partner at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. will allow essentially the same bills to have a different trajectory. ”"
7990,7990,26726,"Alex Jones Leaks Megyn Kelly’s Interview Pitch: ’It’s Not Gonna Be Some Gotcha Hit Piece, I Promise’ - Breitbart",Breitbart,Ezra Dulis,6/16/17,2017,6,,"Alex Jones leaked the audio of a phone conversation Thursday night revealing Megyn Kelly promising him a fair,  “gotcha” interview as she invited him to appear on her new NBC News program. [“I don’t double cross,” Kelly tells Jones, repeatedly assuring him that her interview would not dwell on “conspiracy theories” or familiar   attacks against the independent broadcast host. Rather, Kelly says that the focus of the news profile would be to humanize Jones and explore his personal life.   Jones himself appears in the video, revealing the private phone conversation on his website InfoWars in advance of Kelly’s Sunday broadcast. He annotates the audio clips with his own commentary, NBC’s preview snippet of the   interview, and news clips about the ensuing uproar  —   where a besieged Kelly has denounced Jones’ coverage of the 2012 Sandy Hook mass shooting as “revolting. ” The video puts Kelly in a precarious position. As her fledgling weekend news magazine show fights for viability,   agitators have attacked her for interviewing Jones. A boycott sprang up before the broadcast ever aired, pressuring sponsors and reportedly convincing major brands to pull their . In response, she gave a statement contradicting nearly everything she promised in this phone call. “The very question that prompted this interview,” she claimed, is: “How does Jones, who traffics in these outrageous conspiracy theories, have the respect of the president of the United States and a growing audience of millions?” However, Jones has revealed, her pitch was the exact opposite: “I promise you that’s not what this will be [a hit piece],” she says. “It really will be about, who is this guy?” Later on, she expresses her hope that some liberal viewers would come out of the segment saying, “I see the guy who loves those kids and who is more complex than I’ve been led to believe. ” So, which statement is true? That conclusion is not as easy as one would assume. Kelly now finds herself in the unenviable position of appeasing corporate sponsors spooked by   outrage while also trying to establish herself as a trustworthy interviewer. bShe has nothing to lose if Alex Jones feels betrayed and never talks to her again, but she does express fear during their conversation that if he calls her out for a “hit piece,” she will have trouble getting any more controversial,   subjects to appear on her show. And, based on the preview clips, Kelly will have to square that broken promise with this fervent declaration about her character: She has nothing to lose if Alex Jones feels betrayed and never talks to her again, but she does express fear during their conversation that if he calls her out for a “hit piece,” she will have trouble getting any more controversial,   subjects to appear on her show. And, based on the preview clips, Kelly will have to square that broken promise with this fervent declaration about her character: All I can do is give you my word and tell you  —   if there’s one thing about me, I do what I say I’m gonna do. And I  —   I don’t double cross, so I promise you when it’s over you’ll say, “Absolutely. She did what she said she was gonna do. ” Jones states that he has only released “a few clips” of his full phone conversation with Kelly and that InfoWars taped the entire NBC interview “so that we can document   how she edited, how she manipulated. ” He concludes: “It shows the arrogance of Megyn Kelly that she didn’t think we’d record her to document what she really said and did. ” Read selected transcripts of the Alex   Kelly phone conversation below: KELLY: It’s sort of a good opportunity just for   storytelling. You know, it’s like  —   it’s not like the   interview, it’s like the   profiles of people. And at the top of my list was you. JONES: So it’s like an investigative report into “fake news”? KELLY: No. No, what we’re doing? JONES: Yeah. Come on. KELLY: No no no. Hell no. The reason you  —   I mean, I know you guys, you know, [inaudible]  —   The reason you are interesting to me is because I followed your custody case. And I think you had a very good point about the way the media was covering it and for some reason treated you and your family and what was going on as fair game when they never would have done that to, if you will, a mainstream media figure. And I saw a different side of you in that whole thing and I just  —   here, you know, you became very fascinating to me. I just sort of thought you were this maybe, you know,   guy  —   like, this is your thing  —   and the comments I heard from you during the course of that trial and your plea to the media to be respectful of you and your kids just reminded me that you’re just like anybody. You’re a dad, you go through the same things we go through, and I thought, “now, that would be an interesting story to tell. ”   …     JONES: Wouldn’t the argument be, then, in the show, ’cause I’ve seen that as a standard Democrat talking point  —   I’m not saying that’s what you’re doing  —   “Well, he asked for privacy in his family, but he didn’t do that for Sandy Hook and he didn’t do that for the pizzeria. ” KELLY: No, I mean, I can ask you about that, you know, but this is not gonna be a contentious, you know, sort of “gotcha” exchange. I  —   That’s not what this show is and that’s really not what I want to do. I want to do   profiles on people, just interesting people. So I can ask you that  —   “this is what the critics say”  —   but this isn’t gonna be a “ ! Let’s play a clip. ”   …     JONES: I don’t mind questions. What I don’t like is, did you know or did your producers do that you, where I said Hillary Clinton personally  —   and it was    so I could get the satire out. You guys, took it out of context, but  —   did personally kill kids by the Iraq war and Syria war or the Libya situation, and you guys cut the back off of that   —   it was in the same 30 seconds, where I said I’m not talking about the pizza place, I’m talking about in the Middle East. KELLY: No, this is completely unfamiliar to me. JONES: Remember you had James Alefantis on Fox News, you’re talking about fake news. KELLY: The guy from Comet Pizza? JONES: Yes, and then you played a clip of me saying Hillary personally kills children. KELLY: I, forgive me, Alex, but I don’t remember the clip. I remember him [pause] and, you know, the nature of that exchange, which I think is the only time I’ve ever said  —   um, [inaudible] anything. [In that Fox News segment, Kelly says to Alefantis: “And someone could have been killed inside of your restaurant for no good reason other than people like Alex Jones fanned a conspiracy theory that even the DC police say has no basis in fact. ”] JONES: Sure, sure, sure. I mean, all I’m saying is, I can send you the Right Wing Watch clip where first reported it, and they said, “Jones  ” you know, “said that Hillary killed all these kids but then said it in Syria and Libya. ” So, I mean I’m just telling you, that’s the kind of stuff that scares me, because I can stand for what I’ve said, and I can even say, yeah I probably shouldn’t [crosstalk] Sure, sure. KELLY: Listen, I’ll take a look at that. That’s very unfamiliar to me. All I can tell you is that I bend over backwards to make sure that doesn’t happen.   …     KELLY: I’m sort of  —   you know, for lack of a better term, I’m trying to create a different kind of program. And it’s fine. You know, I’ll ask you about some of the controversies, of course. And you’ll say whatever you want to say. But it’s not going to be some gotcha hit piece, I promise you that. I  —   it doesn’t do me any good. If I do that to you, then you go out there and you say, “She did a hit piece on me. This is what she said, and this is what she did. ” And then the next time I want to get somebody, they’re gonna say, “Look what you did to Alex Jones,” you know. “Screw you. ” So I promise you that’s not what this will be. It really will be about, who is this guy? And we’ll talk about some of the controversy, and I’ll ask you, and you can respond, and we’ll get into the whole, you know, what you’ve been through this past year. And my goal is for your listeners and the left, you know, who will be watching some on NBC, to say, “Wow, that was really interesting. ” [Note: At this point, the audio quality of Kelly’s phone call abruptly changes  —   All I can do is give you my word and tell you  —   if there’s one thing about me, I do what I say I’m gonna do. And I  —   I don’t double cross, so I promise you when it’s over you’ll say, “Absolutely. She did what she said she was gonna do. ” And you’ll be fine with it. I’m not looking to portray you as some boogeyman or, you know, do any sort of a gotcha moment. I just want to talk about you. I want people to get to know you. And the craziest thing of all would be if some of the people who have this insane version of you in their heads walk away saying, “You know what? I see, like, the dad in him. I see the guy who loves those kids and who is more complex than I’ve been led to believe. ” JONES: Sure, but just so you know,  like, on all the Sandy Hook things, I’ve had debates where I’ve shown both sides where I go back and forth, but I believe people died there. And then they never show me really saying that, over the years, you know, you can look where the people that think nobody died are the ones all that hate me on the other side of it. And so what I’m saying is, people take clips out of context  —   and I know I’ve done a lot of stuff, some of which I’m not proud of. So if people want to do a real piece or something, I mean, obviously, I don’t want to sit here and, like, dodge all these interviews. Like, I told  —   they wanted me to tape something for Charlie Rose’s show, they wanted me to tape something for The View. I’m not saying, oh, I’m such a big, you know, famous guy, it’s just that  —   KELLY: No no, I understand. JONES: These taping things really just lends itself to be, you know, to ask yourself to be run over. But I understand, obviously, this is a magazine show, so it’s highly produced.   …     KELLY: It’s like a whole new world over there [at NBC]. They deeply care about this kind of thing [fact checking]. And it’s not that we didn’t care on cable, it’s just a different game on cable. You know, you move faster, and it’s more real time and, you know, that’s just the fact that more mistakes get made. But I will promise you to personally look at any clips we want to use of you and have a producer run by you whether we are taking it in context and what you are saying about  —   JONES: Well, I say some pretty wild stuff, and I’ll admit to a lot of it’s satire, but also, I’m not trying to be, I’m not being fake about what I’m saying.   …     JONES: So this is like a reboot, relaunch for you  —   that you’re not the, you know,   or   pundit from Fox. You’re an investigative journalist that does magazine, you know, investigations, or  —   KELLY: Exactly. So it’s like an entirely different set of muscles. And trust me when I tell you, my goal is not to go out there and be like, “Oh my god, if I sit with her, she’s gonna kill me!” Like  —   but of course I’m gonna do a fair interview. I’m still me! You know, I’m not gonna go out there and be Barbara Walters. You know. You just trust me. It’s  —   I will ask you about the controversies. I will ask you in a non  —   you know, I’ll be fair about it. I’ll give you the chance to respond. And I really just want to talk about you, you know. You.   …     KELLY: I have not enjoyed being, in any way, on the pointy end of the political spear, you know. It was never anything I wanted to do. And so it’s not  —   you know, I would say that I’m a combination of Mike Wallace, Oprah Winfrey, and Larry the Cable Guy. JONES: [Laughter] I know the Larry the Cable Guy. He’s a good guy. KELLY: I love him! And, so, like, that’s what you’ll get in the interview. [Laughter] That’s  —   that’s what you’ll get in the interview. [Laughter] Get, you know, a little bit of all three of those. And hopefully, everybody will walk away feeling like they had a good dinner. You know, nutritious, some red meat, with some dessert at the end."
7991,7991,26727,Report: NSA Spied on Americans Using Blimp - Breitbart,Breitbart,Charlie Nash,4/25/17,2017,4,,"An NSA spy blimp known as the Hover Hammer, which can eavesdrop on civilians from above, was active in Maryland, according to a report by The Intercept. [“To residents of Maryland, catching an occasional glimpse of a huge white blimp floating in the sky is not unusual,” proclaimed The Intercept’s Ryan Gallagher on Monday. “But less known is that the test flights have sometimes served a more secretive purpose involving National Security Agency surveillance. ”  “Back in 2004, a division of the NSA called the National Tactical Integration Office fitted a   diameter airship called the Hover Hammer with an eavesdropping device,” he continued, adding that “The agency launched the   airship at an airfield near Solomons Island, Maryland. ” The blimp was reportedly referred to publicly as an “antenna mounting platform,” and comprises of a “  sphere inside another sphere, constructed of Spectra, the same material used to make   vests. ” “From there, the blimp was able to vacuum up ‘international shipping data emanating from the Long Island, New York area,’” Gallagher explained, citing a classified document published on Monday. “The spy equipment on the airship was called Digital Receiver Technology  —   a proprietary system manufactured by a   company of the same name  —   which can intercept wireless communications, including cellphone calls. ” In his report, Gallagher notes that, “Unsurprisingly, privacy groups have expressed concerns about the prospect of the blimps being used domestically to spy on Americans. However, military officials have often been quick to dismiss such fears. ” “In August 2015, Lt. Shane Glass told Baltimore broadcaster WBAL that the JLENS blimps being tested in Maryland were not equipped with cameras or eavesdropping devices,” he stated, before concluding that “The same cannot be said, it seems, of the NSA’s Hover Hammer. ” Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

7992,7992,26728,"Russia Vetoes U.N. Draft Resolution Condemning Chemical Attack in Syria, China Abstains",Breitbart,John Hayward,4/13/17,2017,4,,"After spending days claiming it would welcome United Nations involvement in the Syrian chemical weapons attack, Russia used its veto power on the U. N. Security Council to block a resolution condemning the attack and calling for its perpetrators to be brought to justice. [China abstained from the vote instead of voting “no,” a decision President Donald Trump praised as “wonderful” and a sign of progress in U. S.  relations since China generally votes with Russia on Syrian affairs.  China’s U. N. ambassador, Liu Jieyi, said the resolution could be “amended” into a form China would vote for and said it was his country’s “longstanding hope that the Security Council can speak with one voice on Syria. ” “With its veto, Russia said no to accountability. Russia once again has chosen to side with Assad, even as the rest of the world, overwhelmingly comes together to condemn this murderous regime,” said the American ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley. “You are isolating yourselves from the international community every time one of Assad’s planes drop another barrel bomb on civilians and every time Assad tries to starve another community to death,” Haley told the Russians. The UK Daily Mail reports on a dramatic confrontation between Russian deputy ambassador Vladimir Safronkov and British ambassador Matthew Rycroft at the U. N. that reportedly occurred on Wednesday night. “Time and time again, Russia has abused its veto protect the regime and to defend its use of chemical weapons,” said Rycroft. “What has Russia got in return for its seven vetoes in six years? Russia’s initiative in 2013 to dismantle Syria’s chemical weapons has been exposed as a shambles. Russian pride in the Astana process has been turned to humiliation and Russia’s credibility and reputation across the world have been poisoned by its toxic association with Assad. ” The “Astana process” is a reference to   Syria peace talks held in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan. Safronkov exploded in a   rant at Rycroft, claiming that the United Kingdom was trying to undermine improving relations between the United States and Russia. “You’re losing sleep that we might be working together with the United States,   with the United States. That is what you fear,” Safronkov thundered at the British ambassador. “You’re doing everything to make sure this kind of cooperation is undermined. What have you done to advance a  ? You welcome various opposition groups in London and Paris, illegal armed groups. ” “Don’t you dare insult Russia again,” Safronkov reportedly told Rycroft, accusing him of “irresponsibility” and using “dirty language. ” At one point during his tirade, when Rycroft turned his attention elsewhere, the Russian deputy ambassador snapped, “Look at me. Don’t turn your eyes away. Why are you looking away?” Safronkov explained that the reason Russia vetoed the U. N. resolution was because it “appointed the guilty party prior to the investigation, prior to an independent and objective investigation,” an approach that was “incompatible with the legal norms. ” However, the U. N. resolution did not actually name the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad as the perpetrator of the attack. It condemned “the reported use of chemical weapons, in particular the attack on Khan Sheikhoun” and called upon the Syrian government to fully cooperate with an investigation by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The resolution, which was drafted by Britain, France, and the United States, would have obliged Syria to provide flight plans and details of air operations on the day of the chemical weapons attack, the names of its helicopter squadron commanders, and access to airbases from which the attack might have been launched. This was evidently the provision to which Russia objected most strongly. Safronkov’s accusation that the U. K. wanted to sabotage relations between Russia and the U. S. might seem odd, given the talk from both Washington and Moscow about how those relations have hit a   War low, but this is emerging as the official Russian narrative about the current diplomatic tension. For example, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Thursday that the Trump administration is under pressure from “those who want to prevent it from curing the wounds inflicted by Barack Obama’s administration, and are using the Russian card in internal political struggles. ” “It’s deplorable, and we regret what is going on, but we can do little except asking to back accusations with facts,” said Lavrov. “There hasn’t been a single fact, although under the pressure of President Donald Trump’s foes the White House has been forced to periodically make statements containing unfounded accusations against us. ”"

7994,7994,26730,Sports Media and Gay Activists Blast Cardinals for Inviting Lance Berkman to ‘Christian Day’ at Busch Stadium - Breitbart,Breitbart,Dylan Gwinn,6/16/17,2017,6,,"The St. Louis Cardinals have found themselves in the crosshairs of the LGBT community for inviting former Cardinal Lance Berkman to the team’s annual Christian Day event. [Berkman’s presence sparks controversy amongst the gay community because of his role in the fight against the transgender bathroom ordinance, aka the “Equal Rights Ordinance,” in Houston in 2015.  Pride Center of St. Louis issued this highly critical statement of the Cardinals decision to invite Berkman: “Pride St. Louis is disappointed by the decision of the St. Louis Cardinals to provide a public platform for Berkman, an individual whose words and actions towards the LGBTQ+ are divisive and demeaning. ” The group initially released the statement to Outsports, an SB Nation website which prioritizes news involving the LGBT community and sports. According to the St. Louis   “On its own, Outsports has called Berkman a “bigot” and “an outspoken opponent of the LGBT community” who was “one of the faces of the campaign against Houston’s   ordinance” in 2015. ” Despite the backlash, as of this writing, the Cardinals remain committed to having Berkman attend “Christian Day. ” The team issued their own statement in response to those troubled by the move: “The Cardinals have hosted a Christian Day at the ballpark for nearly three decades. Lance Berkman participated in Christian Day when he was a Cardinals player, and we welcome him back this year to discuss his faith. ” The Cardinals also said they plan to host an event in support of the LGBT community at some point later in the season. Nonetheless, the team makes a good point here. Berkman has attended and spoken at these events before when he, presumably, held the same views towards transgender bathroom laws that he does now. So, what’s the problem? Since it’s likely that the bathroom issue never would have come up on a night dedicated to celebrating the Christian faith, does the LGBT community really want to put the idea out there that they’re fine with tolerating and accepting all things unless Christianity is involved? In his article on the Cardinals invitation to Berkman, Bill Baer wrote that Berkman “foolishly advocated against public accommodations for transgender people to use public bathrooms. ” What was foolish about this? The part where he exercised his constitutional right to express an opinion in a free country? It seems like Bill Baer’s attitude toward tolerance and acceptance is much the same as Outsports and the LGBT community’s attitude: acceptance and tolerance for all  …    unless they disagree with me.

7995,7995,26731,Pollak: The Attack on Trump Is Exactly What a Russian Disinformation Campaign Looks Like - Breitbart,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,5/28/17,2017,5,,"The accusation that President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign colluded with the Russians, and that he is trying to cover it up, looks increasingly like a classic Russian disinformation campaign  —   one designed to bring down the only president since the Cold War who has actually been willing to confront Russia in any meaningful way. [It is an article of faith on the left that Russia wanted Trump to win the election because Vladimir Putin anticipated a more pliant approach, signaled by Trump’s explicit desire to negotiate a better relationship. But the Russians may just as well have preferred Hillary Clinton, who had given Russia everything it wanted while serving as President Barack Obama’s Secretary of State  —   from the   “reset,” to a surrender of U. S. missile defenses in Eastern Europe, to the sale of 20% of America’s uranium reserves to a Russian company closely tied to the Russian state.  It is more plausible to suggest that Russia simply wants to disrupt American politics if it can get away with doing so, and would do the same regardless of which candidate won the election. Even if  —   for argument’s sake  —   Putin once preferred Trump, that would not preclude him from trying to undermine President Trump now, if possible. And in the “ ” complex, Putin has found a particularly potent weapon, aimed directly at the president. One could not imagine a better way to create havoc for an adversary  —   and the left is playing into the enemy’s hands, eagerly and mindlessly, forgetting its own slavish enthusiasm for Russia for nearly a century. Holman Jenkins, writing in the Wall Street Journal on Saturday, notes that Putin found a unique vulnerability in the   of contemporary American politics, which makes devotees on either side more willing to believe the worst about the other. Partisans on both sides might share a conspiratorial mindset when relegated to opposition status, but only the Democrats can harness the alchemy of the mainstream media to “normalize” fringe theories. Regardless, the flimsiness of the evidence against Trump is a clue. Jenkins notes that it was a dubious “dossier” that alleged that Russia had dirt on Trump that caused much of the initial suspicion last year  —   and that it may well have been fed by Russian sources for that purpose. Add to that the recent revelation that FBI director James Comey suspected that a key email  —   purportedly hacked by Russians, and which implicated Attorney General Loretta Lynch in a scheme to suppress any FBI investigation into Clinton  —   was a fake, and a pattern seems to emerge. Moreover, many of the recent intelligence leaks that have attempted to tie Trump to Putin have been   at best  —   in some cases, laughably so. The information that has been leaked could well have been fabricated  —   or at least fed to unwitting U. S. Intelligence sources who were ready to believe, and convey, the worst. Sen. Lindsey Graham  —   an early critic of Trump’s Russia policy  —   said as much on Sunday, when he speculated that an intercepted message from the Russian ambassador to his bosses back home, claiming that Jared Kushner wanted to set up a “back channel,” could well have been a   exposed on purpose to be intercepted by the U. S. Regardless, Trump is almost certainly right that the Russians are “laughing” at us. The entire political and media establishment is utterly consumed by an obsession with Russian influence for which there is no actual evidence. It is a hysteria worse than that of the McCarthy years, because in those days there really were American communists trying to take over the U. S. government on Moscow’s behalf. Thanks to the “  complex,” this may be the most powerful Russian disinformation campaign ever, and stands on the verge of bringing the American Republic to its knees. Journalists and elected Democrats are busily slapping each other on the back for “standing up for democracy. ” To the extent that they believe it  —   when they are doing the opposite  —   Russia is surely grateful.

7996,7996,26732,Speaker Paul Ryan Lays Out His Tax Reform Plan,Breitbart,Ian Mason,6/20/17,2017,6,,"Speaker of the House Paul Ryan ( ) turned his attention to tax reform Tuesday as he addressed a meeting of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM). [“We are going to fix this nation’s tax code once and for all,” the speaker said to the NAM’s Manufacturing Summit in Washington, DC.  After describing with dismay the complexities and uncertainties of the current tax code, Ryan launched into some specifics of his plan for reform. “First, we will eliminate harmful taxes including the death tax and the alternative minimum tax,” he said. “Next, we will clear out special interest   and expensive deductions,” Ryan continued, explaining that the home mortgage, retirement, and charitable giving deductions would not be on the chopping block. Seven current individual tax brackets would be reduced to three, with the savings from discontinued deductions and streamlining allowing lower tax rates. Ryan promised a “postcard sized” income tax form would be possible under the plan. America’s 35 percent corporate tax rate came into Ryan’s crosshairs, which he compared to Canada’s 15 percent. Ryan partly blamed this tax rate, along with high individual rates for businesses that filed that way, for widespread offshoring of American jobs. “We cannot accept a system that perpetuates the drain of American businesses overseas,” he said. The solution, according to Ryan, is a move to a “territorial system” that allows American companies to move cash from overseas into the country without being taxed. This promise smacked of similarity to the Border Adjustment Tax concept that has caused controversy in earlier Republican tax reform proposals under Ryan’s speakership. Shortly before taking office, President Donald Trump expressed his objections to the concept to the Wall Street Journal. In setting the stage, Ryan touted as legislative successes his caucus’s use of the Congressional Review act, more than a dozen times, to roll back administrative state regulations, before promoting the American Health Care Act (AHCA) the one major bill passed by House Republicans during President Trump’s administration. The AHCA faces an unclear fate in the Senate. Ryan had made clear in the past he was waiting for the House to pass a healthcare bill before moving on taxes. With the House having done so last month, Ryan appeared to be moving forward with plans to introduce tax legislation regardless of how that bill, the AHCA, fares in the Senate. Shortly after the AHCA’s passage, Ryan spoke to New York City’s AM 970 about tax reform prospects, saying, “We are convinced that we can get this done in 2017 so that the economy can really start to take off.   …     All the planets are aligned, meaning you have the House, the Senate and the White House all working on this plan together. ” At the start of the month, House Freedom Caucus chair Mark Meadows told a crowd at the conservative Heritage Institute that he would push for Congress’s August recess to be canceled if a tax bill has not been passed by then. Speaker Ryan seemed to echo that sentiment Tuesday, saying tax reform would move “full speed ahead” but set a later deadline of the end of the year: You will hear that tax reform is coming along. You will hear that it is dead. Then you will hear it is back on track. Then you will hear it is on life support. Sometimes you will hear all of this in the same week, the same day, or heck, even the same hour. Do not be surprised by any of it. But I am here to tell you: We are going to get this done in 2017. We need to get this done in 2017. We cannot let this     moment slip by. Ryan promised that any bill his Caucus introduces will insist on changes to the tax code."

7998,7998,26734,Rogue Bureaucrats at Homeland Security Leak Report Critical of Trump,Breitbart,Michael Patrick Leahy,2/26/17,2017,2,,"Rogue bureaucrats at the Department of Homeland Security have leaked an “incomplete” report critical of President Trump’s executive order that temporarily blocked the issuance of visas to seven Middle Eastern countries that previous administrations had declared “sponsors of state terrorism” or countries of concern. [Based on that leaked document, the Associated Press published a story on Friday with the headline “AP Exclusive: DHS report disputes threat from banned nations. ”    WASHINGTON (AP)  —   Analysts at the Homeland Security Department’s intelligence arm found insufficient evidence that citizens of seven   countries included in President Donald Trump’s travel ban pose a terror threat to the United States. A draft document obtained by The Associated Press concludes that citizenship is an “unlikely indicator” of terrorism threats to the United States and that few people from the countries Trump listed in his travel ban have carried out attacks or been involved in   activities in the U. S. since Syria’s civil war started in 2011. Click here to see the leaked document. “Homeland Security spokeswoman Gillian Christensen on Friday did not dispute the report’s authenticity, but said it was not a final comprehensive review of the government’s intelligence, the AP reported: “While DHS was asked to draft a comprehensive report on this issue, the document you’re referencing was commentary from a single intelligence source versus an official, robust document with thorough interagency sourcing,” Christensen said. “The   …     report does not include data from other intelligence community sources. It is incomplete. ” “The   report challenges Trump’s core claims,” the AP reported: It said that of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to carry out or try to carry out an attack in the United States, just over half were U. S. citizens born in the United States. The others were from 26 countries, led by Pakistan, Somalia, Bangladesh, Cuba, Ethiopia, Iraq and Uzbekistan. Of these, only Somalia and Iraq were among the seven nations included in the ban. Of the other five nations, one person each from Iran, Sudan and Yemen was also involved in those terrorism cases, but none from Syria. It did not say if any were Libyan. Last week, Breitbart News reported that David Grannis, Principal Deputy Undersecretary for Intelligence and Analysis in the Office of Intelligence and Analysis at the Department of Homeland Security, is a holdover Obama bureaucrat who President Trump could remove from his position immediately:  A lifelong Democrat, “[p]rior to joining DHS, Mr. Grannis served as the Staff Director of the U. S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) from 2009 through 2014 and as the Minority Staff Director for 2015. During this time, he served as the principal intelligence advisor to SSCI Chairman Dianne Feinstein and SSCI Members and led the Committee’s efforts to produce and enact annual Intelligence Authorization Act from 2010 through 2016 and the Cybersecurity Act of 2015, according to the DHS website. He has spent his career working for partisan Democratic members of Congress: He previously served as a staff designee to Senator Feinstein on the SSCI from 2005 until 2009 with a varied portfolio of committee responsibilities. Mr. Grannis worked on the House Select Committee on Homeland Security with responsibilities for intelligence, aviation security, and science and technology from 2003 to 2005 and was Senior Policy Advisor to Representative Jane Harman on matters of national security from 2001 to 2003. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security would neither confirm nor deny that Grannis was the author of, or had reviewed, the leaked draft document, though it did appear to be authored by someone associated with his area of responsibility within DHS. “The report was incomplete and had not been subject to the extensive interagency review process required of finished intelligence products,” spokesperson Gillian Christensen tells Breitbart News, adding: Further, the report does not include data from other intelligence community sources. It is clear on its face that it is an incomplete product. Allegations by opponents of the president’s policies that senior DHS intelligence officials would politicize intelligence is unfortunate and untrue. The dispute with this product was over sources and quality, not politics. The leaked document appears to be a clearly partisan attack on President Trump’s agenda by an analyst working within the Department of Homeland Security. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Christensen did not answer questions from Breitbart News about whether Grannis had authored or reviewed the leaked incomplete report. Christensen also did not answer a question from Breitbart News if the Department of Homeland Security had discovered the identity of the bureaucrat who leaked the incomplete report to the Associated Press. The leaked report contains several significant flaws. It says, for instance, that   is not a good indicator of terrorism, but does not admit that religion is a primary indicator. In addition, the data included in the report is dramatically different than the data reported in another list of terrorists compiled by former Senator, now Attorney General, Jeff Sessions."
7999,7999,26735,"Amazon to Add 100,000 Employees for Automated Market - Breitbart",Breitbart,Chriss W. Street,1/15/17,2017,1,,"Despite CEO Jeff Bezos’s political battles with   Donald Trump, Amazon is going   by pledging to hire 100, 000 U. S. employees with full benefits to launch its   grocery markets, which are expected to offer drone delivery services. [Amazon. com (OTC: AMZN) currently has about 180, 000   employees in the United States and over 306, 000 full and   employees worldwide. That represents about a 33 percent increase over the 230, 800 at the end of 2015.  With 600 percent employment growth in the last 5 years, Amazon’s employee base is now 3 times Microsoft’s direct workforce and over 4 times Google parent Alphabet’s 70, 000 employees. Unlike other tech companies that are automating away employment or replacing Americans with   foreigners, Amazon is accelerating hiring. Most of Amazon’s U. S. growth has been at its 18 “Fulfilment by Amazon” service centers. Although the centers open with   employees, Amazon’s CFO Brian Olsavsky recently stated that due to expansion factors, the company is converting more temporary employees to   positions. The next big phase for Amazon’s growth will be the   of 1, 800   “Amazon Go” grocery stores, which will feature clerkless shopping. The company opened its pilot store at one of Amazon’s downtown Seattle headquarters buildings. Food options include fresh produce, frozen foods, packaged grocery and prepared food options. Only Amazon   “blue badge” staffers can enter right now, but ARS Technica reported that the      stores will be soon be open to Amazon Prime members who download a smartphone app. Through a combination of cameras and sensors powered by machine learning to track users’ activity, Amazon Go users can   and their account will br billed as they walk out of the store. With a huge inventory of     apartments with vacant ground floor retail space dotting most major cities, Amazon Go will have no problem rolling out their concept nationally. In a move apparently timed to the public launch of Go, Amazon filed a Federal Communications Commission application for a Special Temporary Authority permit to use of an indoor and outdoor wireless communications system in Seattle and rural Washington. The application states: “Amazon seeks FCC experimental authority to evaluate prototype equipment and associated software designed to support innovative communications capabilities and functionalities. ” It is signed by former NASA astronaut Neil Woodward, who manages of flight test and certification for Amazon Prime Air. Amazon’s application also “seeks to collect sufficient data within that time frame to assess the performance and reliability characteristics of prototype equipment and software to determine if additional research is needed and should be scheduled. ” Rumors in the tech world suggest the system will support Amazon Go drone deliveries. Amazon has already started making its first drone package deliveries in the UK, but Federal Aviation Administration regulations have limited the tech giant’s ability to conduct tests in its home market. Amazon patents applications include a “collective UAV” that would combine a flock of drones to pick up and deliver heavier items."

C.  —   At approximately the time that the U. S. House of Representatives was supposed to vote on Speaker Paul Ryan’s Obamacare replacement bill —  the American Health Care Act (AHCA) —  news broke that the vote had again been canceled. [Reporter Bob Costa posted news of the bill’s cancellation:  President Trump just called me.

Later reports indicated it was Ryan who urged Trump that the bill needed to be pulled. It was unclear as of Friday afternoon who was ultimately responsible for the decision to pull the bill. The vote was previously scheduled for Thursday evening, but was canceled within hours of the White House assuring that there would be a vote. Vice President Mike Pence had canceled Friday plans to travel and promote the AHCA in two states to remain in Washington, D. C. and work with the President. White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said Thursday that if the House Leadership’s bill failed, Obamacare would remain, according to several reports. “There were a lot of emotional pleas last night that might cause people to take off their thinking hats and react with their hearts, rather than their heads, and support what we all know is bad legislation,” Rep. Mo Brooks ( ) said on Friday morning to SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Breitbart News Daily. Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana "

We are evaluating our New Year’s Eve coverage and have made no decisions at this point. ” Cooper denounced Griffin’s photo in a short statement on Twitter. “For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in.

A full refund to any guests who purchased a ticket was also promised. Griffin’s social media accounts were flooded with calls from social media users urging others to boycott her upcoming   comedy tour dates and venues to deny her a platform to perform. President Trump tweeted Wednesday morning that Griffin’s photo had been difficult for his children, including his    son, Barron. Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself.

Secret Service, however, is reportedly investigating the “circumstances” surrounding the photo shoot. “The U. S. Secret Service has a critical mission. It is always unfortunate when people make statements that could be perceived as threats,” the agency said in a statement, according to ABC News. “We don’t have the luxury of knowing a person’s intent. Each alleged or perceived threat has to be investigated thoroughly which taxes Secret Service manpower and resources that could be utilized elsewhere. ”   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson"
